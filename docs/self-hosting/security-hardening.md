# Security hardening

BottleCRM is multi-tenant: every deployment holds more than one organization's data behind the same
database and the same application process. This page collects the settings and surfaces that matter
most once you're running something other people depend on, most of which are covered in more depth
elsewhere in Self-hosting. This page is the checklist, with pointers to the detail.

## Production checklist

- **`DEBUG=False`.** `crm/settings.py` reads it as `os.environ.get("DEBUG", "False").lower() ==
  "true"`, so it's already `False` by default. The failure mode to avoid is `.env.docker` (which
  ships `DEBUG=True` for local development) carrying into a production environment unchanged.
- **A real `SECRET_KEY`**, not the shipped `django-insecure-...` placeholder. See
  [Secrets](#secrets) below.
- **`ALLOWED_HOSTS`** set to your real hostname(s), and **`CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`** set with a scheme
  (`https://crm.example.com`, not a bare hostname), both detailed in
  [Production deployment](production-deploy.md#required-settings).
- **`CORS_ALLOW_ALL=False`** (the default) with **`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** scoped to your real
  frontend origin(s); `.env.docker` sets `CORS_ALLOW_ALL=True` for local development, which should
  not carry into production either.
- **`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`** added yourself if you terminate TLS at a reverse proxy, nothing in
  `crm/settings.py` sets it, so without it Django never considers a proxied request secure and the
  HSTS headers this project does set unconditionally (`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`,
  `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`, `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD`) silently never get sent. See
  [Production deployment](production-deploy.md#reverse-proxy).
- **A non-superuser database role**: see [Database role](#database-role) below.
- **Don't set `ENV_TYPE=prod` casually.** It's not just a flag: it makes `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`,
  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SES_REGION_NAME`, `AWS_SES_REGION_ENDPOINT` and
  `SENTRY_DSN` mandatory (a `KeyError` at startup if any is missing), switches email to Amazon SES,
  and hardcodes `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN = ".bottlecrm.io"`, a domain specific to this project's own
  SaaS hosting. See [Production deployment](production-deploy.md#static-files) before setting it.

## Database role

The single highest-leverage setting in this list: `DBUSER` must not be a PostgreSQL superuser, or
every Row-Level Security policy in the schema is bypassed silently, with no error and no log line.
The default (`DBUSER` unset, falling back to `postgres`) is a superuser on most installations. Create
a dedicated role and confirm it isn't one:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python manage.py manage_rls --verify-user
```

Full detail: how to create the role, how RLS policies are applied, and how to prove isolation holds
for real data rather than trusting that it does, is in
[PostgreSQL and RLS](postgresql-and-rls.md).

## Secrets

`SECRET_KEY` does more than Django's usual signing duties here: `SIMPLE_JWT["SIGNING_KEY"]` in
`crm/settings.py` is set to `SECRET_KEY` directly, so it is also the key every access and refresh
token is signed and verified with. There is no separate JWT signing-key setting anywhere in this
codebase, rotating `SECRET_KEY` invalidates every outstanding access and refresh token immediately,
which is worth knowing before you rotate it as a routine maintenance step rather than in response to
an actual compromise.

`crm/settings.py` itself guards against the worst case of forgetting to set it: if `SECRET_KEY` is
empty or still starts with `"django-insecure"` **and** `ENV_TYPE` is anything other than `dev`, the
module raises `ValueError("SECRET_KEY must be set to a secure value in non-dev environments")` at
import time, a hard startup failure rather than a silent insecure default. That guard only fires
when `ENV_TYPE` is explicitly non-`dev`, so set a real, unique `SECRET_KEY` regardless of whether you
ever set `ENV_TYPE=prod`.

## Token surfaces

Three different credential types exist, with different blast radii if one leaks:

- **Personal access tokens** (`bcrm_pat_...`, managed at `profile/tokens/`) are scoped to the one
  profile that created them. `resolve_valid_pat()` in `backend/common/pat_auth.py` checks
  `pat.profile.is_active` (and `pat.org.is_active`) on every use, so deactivating a profile cuts off
  its personal access tokens immediately. There's no separate token-revocation step required when
  offboarding someone.
- **Admin oversight of tokens** is separate from the self-service surface above: `org/tokens/`
  (`OrgAccessTokenListView`/`OrgAccessTokenDetailView`) is admin-only and org-wide. An admin can see
  and revoke any token in their org, including one belonging to a colleague who has since been
  deactivated. It's deliberately a distinct endpoint from `profile/tokens/` rather than a widened
  version of it, so the self-service guard never has to be loosened to support oversight.
- **The org API key** (`GET`/`POST /api/org/api-key/`, `OrgApiKeyView`, admin-only) is the bluntest
  of the three: `common/middleware/get_company.py`'s `_process_api_key_auth` resolves a request
  bearing this key to the org's first active `ADMIN` profile. One key per tenant, never expiring,
  so it cannot be revoked per integration. It is read-only and barred from the credential endpoints
  (`common/scopes.py`), which stops a leaked key deleting records, escalating a role, or minting a
  personal access token owned by the admin whose identity it borrowed. It still reads every record
  in the org. It's kept out of every nested API representation and served only by this endpoint.
  **Set `DJANGO_ORG_API_KEY_AUTH=false` once every integration uses a personal access token**, which
  refuses the key as an authentication method entirely. If it's ever exposed: committed to a repo,
  logged, shared over an insecure channel, rotate it with `POST /api/org/api-key/` from a signed-in
  session; the response is explicit that "the previous key is no longer valid" immediately on
  rotation.
- **No token can manage a credential.** `/api/profile/tokens/`, `/api/org/tokens/` and
  `/api/org/api-key/` are refused for any personal access token and for the org API key, whatever
  their scopes. Both chains would otherwise defeat revocation: a token that mints tokens leaves
  children behind when you revoke it, and a token that reads the org API key upgrades itself into a
  credential that outlives its own revocation. Credential management requires an interactive
  sign-in.

## What to monitor

`SecurityAuditLog` (`backend/common/audit_log.py`, table `security_audit_log`) is an RLS-protected,
per-org table of security-relevant events, with a matching `security.audit` Python logger that also
writes to `security_audit.log` (configured in `crm/settings.py`'s `LOGGING` dict). It's worth
watching, with one caveat: of the thirteen event types the model defines
(`LOGIN_SUCCESS`, `LOGIN_FAILURE`, `LOGOUT`, `ORG_SWITCH`, `TOKEN_REFRESH`, `TOKEN_REVOKED`,
`PERMISSION_DENIED`, `CROSS_ORG_ATTEMPT`, `API_KEY_USED`, `API_KEY_INVALID`, `MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`,
`SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`, `SAMPLE_DATA_CLEARED`), only `LOGIN_SUCCESS`, `ORG_SWITCH`, `TOKEN_REFRESH`,
`TOKEN_REVOKED`, `PERMISSION_DENIED` (from one call site) and `SAMPLE_DATA_CLEARED` are actually
logged anywhere in the application code as of this writing. `LOGIN_FAILURE`, `LOGOUT`,
`CROSS_ORG_ATTEMPT`, `API_KEY_USED`, `API_KEY_INVALID`, `MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED` and
`SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY` are defined on the model and have corresponding methods on the `AuditLogger`
helper, but nothing in the codebase currently calls them. Don't rely on this table to surface a
brute-forced login or a bad API key attempt today; it doesn't yet.
