# Environment variables

This page is the exhaustive table: every environment variable `backend/crm/settings.py` reads,
its real default, and what it's for. [Self-hosting: Environment variables](../self-hosting/environment-variables.md)
is the narrative companion. How configuration loading actually works (`load_dotenv()`, the
`.env.docker` / `.env.docker.local` layering), and the smaller, curated list of variables an
operator actually has to touch to run a working, non-default install. Read that page first if
you're setting up a deployment; come back here when you need the complete list or an exact default.

## How to set them

Every variable in the table below is read with `os.environ.get("NAME", <default>)` (or the
equivalent `os.getenv`) directly in `crm/settings.py`, at process import time: `manage.py
runserver`, `migrate`, a Gunicorn/Uvicorn worker, a Celery worker, and every management command all
read the same values the same way. A `.env` file next to `manage.py` (for a manual install) or
`.env.docker`/`.env.docker.local` (for the Docker Compose stack) is loaded into the process
environment before any of these calls run, so an unset variable falls back to the default in the
**Default** column rather than crashing immediately. That's true even for `SECRET_KEY`: its own
`os.environ.get` call always succeeds, but the value it produces then feeds a separate check a few
lines later that raises `ValueError` once `ENV_TYPE` is anything other than `dev` (see the
`SECRET_KEY` row below): a default that satisfies `os.environ.get` doesn't necessarily satisfy
everything downstream of it. The variables with genuinely no default in code. Read with plain
`os.environ[...]`, so a missing one is an immediate `KeyError` rather than a fallback. Live outside
`crm/settings.py` entirely and are covered in the list below instead of the table.

Three groups of real, project-read environment variables are **not** read by `crm/settings.py`
itself, so they aren't in the table below:

- **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`** is read directly by the `create_default_admin` management command (see
  [Management commands](management-commands.md#create_default_admin)). It still gets its own row
  below because it's part of the same Docker bootstrap flow as `ADMIN_EMAIL`, which *is* read in
  `settings.py`.
- **`AWS_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN`** are read with
  plain `os.environ[...]` (no default) inside `backend/crm/server_settings.py`, which
  `crm/settings.py` only imports when `ENV_TYPE=prod`. A missing one is a `KeyError` at import
  time. The process refuses to start rather than starting half-configured. `ENV_TYPE` itself
  follows the same rule: it's read in `settings.py`, but it's the internal dev/prod switch this
  project's own tests exclude from the table by design, not a self-hoster-facing setting on its
  own. See [Production deployment](../self-hosting/production-deploy.md#required-settings) and
  [Security hardening](../self-hosting/security-hardening.md#secrets) for what `ENV_TYPE=prod`
  actually requires and why it shouldn't be set casually.
- **`BCRM_MCP_ENABLED`** and **`BCRM_BASE_URL`** are no longer read anywhere. They gated the
  MCP server that used to be mounted at `/mcp`, which has been removed in favour of the REST API.
  Both are safe to delete from an existing deployment's environment. See
  [AI agents](../integrations/ai-agents.md) for how an agent connects now.

## Reference

### Django core

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | `django-insecure-dev-key-please-change-in-production` | Yes, once `ENV_TYPE` is anything other than `dev` (see above) | Django's cryptographic signing key. It also *is* the JWT `SIGNING_KEY`: `SIMPLE_JWT["SIGNING_KEY"]` is set to `SECRET_KEY` directly, so there is no separate JWT signing key setting anywhere in this codebase, and rotating `SECRET_KEY` invalidates every outstanding access and refresh token. **It must be at least 32 bytes.** HS256 signs the JWTs, and RFC 7518 section 3.2 requires an HMAC key at least as long as the hash output; a shorter one raises at import time outside `dev` and warns inside it. Generate one with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"`. See [Architecture: Authentication](../architecture/authentication.md#token-model) and [Security hardening](../self-hosting/security-hardening.md#secrets). |
| `DEBUG` | `False` | No | Django debug mode. Also the sole gate on the `devlogin` management command. See [Management commands](management-commands.md#devlogin). |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `localhost,127.0.0.1` | Yes, once serving traffic under a real hostname | Comma-separated list, split on `,` into Django's `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. |
| `TRUST_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` | `False` | Yes, if TLS is terminated by a proxy in front of Django | Set to `true` (case-insensitive) to set Django's `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` to `("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO", "https")`. Without it, a request arriving from nginx or an ALB over plain HTTP makes `request.is_secure()` false, and `SecurityMiddleware` then emits **no** `Strict-Transport-Security` header at all, so the `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` / `INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS` / `PRELOAD` settings are silently inert. Only turn it on when that proxy is the sole route to the app **and** it overwrites `X-Forwarded-Proto` rather than passing through a client-supplied one, because otherwise any caller reaching Django directly can make `request.is_secure()` return true. The http-to-https redirect belongs on the proxy; `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` is deliberately not set. |
| `DJANGO_ORG_API_KEY_AUTH` | `true` | No | Set to `false`, `0`, `no` or `off` to refuse the organization API key (`Token: <org.api_key>`) as an authentication method entirely, on every endpoint. The key is one non-expiring credential per tenant that resolves to an arbitrary active ADMIN, so it cannot be revoked per-integration and it reads every record in the org. It is read-only and barred from the credential endpoints even when enabled (see [Tokens and API keys](../api/tokens-and-api-keys.md)), but a deployment whose integrations have all moved to personal access tokens should turn it off. Left on by default so an upgrade breaks nothing. |

### Database

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DBNAME` | `crm_db` | No | PostgreSQL database name. |
| `DBUSER` | `postgres` | Yes, before anyone but you can reach the instance | PostgreSQL role. The default is the PostgreSQL superuser account on most installations, and a superuser silently bypasses every RLS policy this project relies on for tenant isolation. See [PostgreSQL and RLS: Creating the application role](../self-hosting/postgresql-and-rls.md#creating-the-application-role). |
| `DBPASSWORD` | `postgres` | Yes, alongside `DBUSER` | PostgreSQL password. |
| `DBHOST` | `localhost` | No | PostgreSQL host. |
| `DBPORT` | `5432` | No | PostgreSQL port. |

### Connection pooling

Pooling uses psycopg 3's `psycopg_pool` through Django's PostgreSQL backend. It is **off by default**, so upgrading does not silently change an existing deployment's connection behaviour. Turning it on also enables `CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS`; `CONN_MAX_AGE` is pinned to `0`, because Django raises `ImproperlyConfigured` ("Pooling doesn't support persistent connections") if a pool is configured alongside persistent connections.

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_POOL_ENABLED` | `False` | No | `"true"` (case-insensitive) puts a `psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool` in front of the default database and installs the RLS reset callback described below. Anything else leaves the connection behaviour unchanged. |
| `DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` | `2` | No | Connections the pool keeps open per process even when idle. |
| `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` | `10` | No | Ceiling on concurrent connections per process. This is the limit that was missing when the API exhausted PostgreSQL: under ASGI every in-flight request otherwise takes its own connection with no upper bound. |

**Size this against `max_connections`, and remember the pool is per process, not per host.** Peak usage is roughly `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE × (uvicorn workers + Celery prefork children)`, plus `DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` held idle by each of those processes. `docker-compose.yml` runs `celery -A crm worker` with no `--concurrency`, so each worker forks one child per CPU. On an 8-core host with 3 uvicorn workers and the defaults, that is `10 × (3 + 8) = 110` connections at peak against PostgreSQL's default `max_connections` of 100.

**Why the reset callback matters.** RLS context lives in `app.current_org`, a session-scoped setting that outlives the transaction and the request. `psycopg_pool` does not clear session state when a connection is returned; it only rolls back an open transaction. A pool without `common.rls.pool.reset_rls_context` therefore hands the next borrower a connection still scoped to the previous tenant. Enabling `DB_POOL_ENABLED` wires that callback in automatically, and `common/tests/test_pool_rls_isolation.py` proves both that it clears the context and that it leaves the connection in the `IDLE` state `psycopg_pool` requires. Do not configure a pool by hand without it.

### Email

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EMAIL_BACKEND` | `django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend` | No | Django email backend. The default prints outbound mail to stdout instead of sending it. Setting `ENV_TYPE=prod` overrides this unconditionally to `django_ses.SESBackend`, regardless of what this variable is set to. See [Email and Celery](../self-hosting/email-and-celery.md#amazon-ses). |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | `noreply@localhost` | No | `From` address on outbound mail. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@localhost` | No | Assigned to `settings.ADMIN_EMAIL` but not consumed anywhere else in `settings.py` itself. The one place it's read outside this module and `create_default_admin` (see below) is `common/views/user_views.py`, which returns it as `admin_email` in the user-list API response context. `create_default_admin` also reads `ADMIN_EMAIL` a second time, independently and with the same default, to name the bootstrap Django superuser account. |
| `AWS_SES_REGION_NAME` | `ap-south-1` | No, unless `ENV_TYPE=prod` | Only read when `"django_ses"` appears in `EMAIL_BACKEND`. True if you set `EMAIL_BACKEND=django_ses.SESBackend` directly, or unconditionally true once `ENV_TYPE=prod` forces that backend. Under `ENV_TYPE=prod`, `server_settings.py` requires this variable outright (`os.environ[...]`, no default) before `settings.py`'s own conditional read ever runs, so the default above is effectively unreachable in that mode. |
| `AWS_SES_REGION_ENDPOINT` | `email.<AWS_SES_REGION_NAME>.amazonaws.com` | No, unless `ENV_TYPE=prod` | Same condition and the same `ENV_TYPE=prod`-makes-it-required caveat as `AWS_SES_REGION_NAME` above. |

### Celery and Redis

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CELERY_BROKER_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379/0` | Yes, before anyone but you can reach the instance | Redis URL Celery uses as its message broker. |
| `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` | `redis://localhost:6379/0` | Yes, alongside `CELERY_BROKER_URL` | Redis URL Celery uses to store task results. |

### CORS and CSRF

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ALL` | `False` | No | Sets Django's `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL`. Note the name doesn't match the Django setting it controls. `"true"` (case-insensitive) allows every origin; anything else leaves it off. |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173` | Yes, once the frontend is served from a real domain | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins; each entry is stripped of surrounding whitespace and empty entries are dropped. |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | *(empty, no trusted origins)* | Yes, before anyone but you can reach the instance | Comma-separated list, same stripping rule as `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Each entry needs a scheme, e.g. `https://crm.example.com`. A bare hostname is silently useless to Django's CSRF check. |

### URLs

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DOMAIN_NAME` | `http://localhost:8000` | No. Nothing reads it any more | Base URL of the **backend**. It no longer reaches a single emitted link. The four remaining reads (`invoices/tasks.py:305,482` and `invoices/api_views.py:276,436`) pass it as the `domain=` kwarg of Celery tasks whose signatures keep that parameter only so a task queued before the change still unpacks after deploy, and whose docstrings say it is ignored. Every link now comes from `FRONTEND_URL` via `common/links.py`. It used to build the internal "assigned to you" notifications as well as the customer-facing invoice, estimate and CSAT links, and every one of those was broken: the builders wrote `f"{protocol}://{domain}/..."` around a value that already carried a scheme, so the emitted link had two, and the paths are frontend routes that do not exist on the backend host. Setting this variable changes nothing; it is kept so an existing `.env` does not have to be edited. |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | **Yes**, once self-hosted under a real domain | Base URL of the SvelteKit frontend, and the single source for every link that leaves the system in an email: the welcome email and magic-link sign-in URL (`common/tasks.py`), the emailed invoice and estimate portal links, the CSAT survey link, and the "assigned to you" invoice link (all via `common.links.frontend_url`). The customer-facing ones go to people outside the organization, so leaving the `localhost` default in a real deployment emails dead links to customers. **That is now refused rather than emailed:** when `ENV_TYPE` is anything other than `dev`, `crm/settings.py` raises at import if this points at a loopback host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `::1`) or is not an absolute `http`/`https` URL, so the deploy fails to start instead of failing silently on somebody else's inbox. Plain HTTP against a real host is allowed, for a deployment behind its own TLS terminator. A trailing slash is stripped, so `https://app.example.com` and `https://app.example.com/` behave the same. |

### Google OAuth

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | *(empty)* | No, leaving it blank disables Google sign-in | OAuth client ID sent to Google's token endpoint and used as the expected audience when verifying a mobile ID token. See [Google OAuth](../self-hosting/google-oauth.md#backend-configuration). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(empty)* | No, leaving it blank disables Google sign-in | OAuth client secret, alongside `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` above. |

### Docker bootstrap (not read by `crm/settings.py`)

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(empty string)* | No, but leaving it unset is a real security gap | Read directly by the `create_default_admin` management command. An empty value doesn't mean "no password", the command falls back to the literal password `admin` and prints a warning. `create_default_admin` runs automatically on every Docker container start (`docker/backend/entrypoint.sh`, right after `migrate`), so an unset `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in a real deployment means the bootstrap Django superuser's password is the literal string `admin` until someone changes it. See [Management commands](management-commands.md#create_default_admin). |
