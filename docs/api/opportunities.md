# Opportunities

Routes in `backend/opportunity/urls.py`, views split across `opportunity/views/opportunity_views.py`
(list and detail) and `opportunity/views/kanban_views.py` (stage board and move). See
[Conventions](conventions.md) for pagination, filtering and response-shape rules assumed rather than
repeated here.

## List opportunities

`GET /api/opportunities/` (`OpportunityListView.get`, `backend/opportunity/views/opportunity_views.py:272-274`)
returns a single paginated list plus org-wide `totals` computed over the whole filtered queryset, not
just the current page (`get_totals`, `:73-110`):

```json
{
  "opportunities_count": 23,
  "totals": {"count": 23, "amount_sum": "184500.00", "weighted_sum": "97250.00", "stalled_count": 2},
  "offset": 10,
  "per_page": 10,
  "page_number": [1],
  "opportunities": [ { "...": "OpportunitySerializer" } ],
  "accounts_list": [ { "...": "AccountSerializer" } ],
  "contacts_list": [ { "...": "ContactSerializer" } ],
  "tags": [ { "...": "..." } ],
  "stage": [["PROSPECTING", "Prospecting"], ["QUALIFICATION", "Qualification"]],
  "lead_source": [["NONE", "NONE"], ["CALL", "CALL"], ["WEBSITE", "WEBSITE"]],
  "currency": [["USD", "USD, Dollar"]]
}
```

`weighted_sum` is the forecast, `SUM(amount * probability / 100)`, as opposed to `amount_sum`,
which is what every open and closed deal in the filtered set is worth at face value
(`:90-98`). `stalled_count` uses the same per-stage aging thresholds as `?rotten=true` below and as
`Opportunity.get_aging_status()`; see [Stages](#stages). A non-admin caller only sees deals they
created or are assigned to (`:119-131`).

Filters: `name`, `search` (both `icontains` against `name` only; `search` here does **not** OR
across multiple fields the way it does on [Leads](leads.md#list-leads)); `account` (exact); `stage`,
`lead_source` (**`__contains`, not exact**. See [Stages](#stages) for why this matters); `tags`,
`assigned_to` (repeatable, id lists); `created_at__gte/lte`, `closed_on__gte/lte`,
`amount__gte/lte`; `cf_<key>`; and two boolean flags, `open=true` (excludes closed stages) and
`rotten=true` (stalled deals only). See [Stages](#stages) (`opportunity_views.py:133-192`).

## Create an opportunity

`POST /api/opportunities/` (`OpportunityListView.post`, `opportunity_views.py:292-413`) is validated
by `OpportunityCreateSerializer` (`opportunity/serializer.py:199-297`); see [Fields](#fields). On
success (`200`):

```json
{"error": false, "message": "Opportunity Created Successfully", "id": "<uuid>"}
```

**`name` must be unique per org, case-insensitive** (`validate_name`,
`opportunity/serializer.py:213-228`). The serializer also enforces, at the API layer, the two rules
`Opportunity.clean()` states at the model layer. Closed deals need a close date, and `CLOSED_WON`
deals need an amount (`validate()`, `:242-268`; see [Stages](#stages)), because DRF's
`ModelSerializer` never calls `Model.clean()`, so without this the model's own rules would only be
enforced by unit tests against the model, never through the API.
`contacts`, `tags`, `teams` and `assigned_to` are resolved from the request body the same
list-of-ids way as [Leads](leads.md#create-a-lead) and [Accounts](accounts.md#create-an-account)
(`opportunity_views.py:317-376`); `opportunity_attachment` is accepted as a multipart file.

## Retrieve, update, delete

`GET /api/opportunities/{id}/` (`OpportunityDetailView.get`, `opportunity_views.py:661-736`) looks the
deal up scoped to the caller's org. Unlike leads/accounts/contacts, this lookup returns `None` rather
than raising, so a missing or cross-org id comes back as an explicit `404` response
(`"error": true, "errors": "Opportunity not found."`, `:663-667`) instead of Django's
`get_object_or_404`. `assert_deal_access` (`:423-447`) then requires the caller to be an admin, the
deal's creator, or one of its assignees, or the request is refused with `403`. The response nests the
record under `opportunity_obj`, and also returns `comments`, `attachments`, `contacts`,
`users`, `stage`, `lead_source`, `currency`, `comment_permission`, `users_mention` and
`custom_field_definitions`.

`PUT /api/opportunities/{id}/` (`:464-596`) and `PATCH /api/opportunities/{id}/` (`:831-953`) both
enforce `assert_deal_access`, and both stamp `closed_by = request.profile` and persist it with an
explicit `.save()` whenever the incoming `stage` is `CLOSED_WON` or `CLOSED_LOST`
(`:537-539`, `:942-944`), a deal moved into a closed stage always records who closed it. Both clear
and re-add `contacts`/`tags`/`teams`/`assigned_to` from the request body the same way create does.
Success: `{"error": false, "message": "Opportunity Updated Successfully"}`.

`DELETE /api/opportunities/{id}/` (`:612-637`) allows an admin, a superuser, or the deal's own creator
(`request.profile.user != self.object.created_by`, a `User`-to-`User` comparison, `:624-632`).
Anyone else gets `403`.

## Stages

**`stage` is a fixed, org-wide enum, not a configurable pipeline.** `Opportunity.stage` is a
`CharField` with `choices=STAGES` and `default="PROSPECTING"`
(`opportunity/models.py:54-56`; `STAGES` in `backend/common/utils.py:87-94`):
`PROSPECTING`, `QUALIFICATION`, `PROPOSAL`, `NEGOTIATION`, `CLOSED_WON`, `CLOSED_LOST`. There is no
`Pipeline`/`Stage` model behind it the way there is for the other three record types that have a
Kanban board in this API: `LeadPipeline`/`LeadStage` (`leads/models.py:229-330`),
`CasePipeline`/`CaseStage` (`cases/models.py:490,527`), and `Board`/`BoardColumn` for tasks
(`tasks/models.py:16,83`) are all per-org, admin-configurable. Opportunity's Kanban view says this
about itself in its own module docstring: "Status-based only (Opportunity has no Pipeline/Stage model.
It groups by the flat `stage` CharField)" (`opportunity/views/kanban_views.py:1-6`). Every org gets
the same six stages; there is no endpoint to add, rename or reorder them.

Two consequences of moving a deal between stages, both enforced server-side (see
[Create an opportunity](#create-an-opportunity)): entering `CLOSED_WON` or `CLOSED_LOST` requires
`closed_on`; entering `CLOSED_WON` specifically also requires `amount`
(`CLOSED_STAGES`, `AMOUNT_REQUIRED_STAGES`, `opportunity/workflow.py:17-21`). `probability` is
auto-filled from a fixed per-stage default (`STAGE_PROBABILITIES`, `workflow.py:8-15`) whenever the
value on the record is `0` or unset (`Opportunity.save()`, `opportunity/models.py:262-264`). Sending
your own `probability` still works, this only fills the gap when you don't.

**Filtering by stage is a substring match, not an exact one**: `?stage=` and `?lead_source=` both
compile to `__contains` (`opportunity_views.py:138-143`), unlike `Lead.status`/`Lead.source`, which
are exact matches (see [Leads](leads.md#list-leads)). `?stage=CLOSED` therefore matches both
`CLOSED_WON` and `CLOSED_LOST`; `?stage=closed` (lowercase) matches neither, because `__contains` on a
`CharField` is case-sensitive.

`?rotten=true` on `GET /api/opportunities/` and the `stalled_count` in its `totals` both use the same
definition as `Opportunity.get_aging_status()`: a deal is stalled once it has sat in its current,
non-closed stage for at least `expected_days * 1.5` (`ROTTEN_MULTIPLIER`, `workflow.py:32`), where
`expected_days` comes from the org's `StageAgingConfig` for that stage if one exists, else a built-in
default (`DEFAULT_STAGE_EXPECTED_DAYS`, `workflow.py:24-29`; `stalled_filter`,
`opportunity_views.py:43-66`).

`GET /api/opportunities/kanban/` (`OpportunityKanbanView.get`, `kanban_views.py:39-120`) returns one
column per `STAGES` value, applying the same org/role scoping and a subset of the list filters
(`search`, `account`, `assigned_to`, `tags`, `closed_on__gte/lte`):

```json
{
  "mode": "status",
  "pipeline": null,
  "columns": [
    {"id": "PROSPECTING", "name": "Prospecting", "order": 1, "color": "#3B82F6", "stage_type": "open", "is_status_column": true, "wip_limit": null, "item_count": 4, "items": [ { "...": "OpportunityKanbanCardSerializer" } ]}
  ],
  "total_items": 23
}
```

`"pipeline": null` is not a placeholder for missing data. It is always `null` here, precisely because
there is no pipeline object behind this board.

`PATCH /api/opportunities/{id}/move/` (`OpportunityMoveView.patch`, `kanban_views.py:140-204`)
**requires `stage`**: `OpportunityMoveSerializer.stage` is a `ChoiceField` with no `required=False`
(`opportunity/serializer.py:362-367`, whose own docstring says so explicitly), and the view reads
`data["stage"]` unconditionally (`kanban_views.py:178`), a reorder-only body with no `stage` key gets
a `400`, not a silent no-op reorder. When `stage` is sent, `kanban_order` can optionally come with it
to reorder within the (possibly new) column at the same time (fractional indexing, same convention as
tasks, averaging two neighbors' `kanban_order`, or offsetting by ±1000 with only one neighbor given).
Its own access check
intends to mirror `assert_deal_access` (admin, creator, or assignee) but the creator half is broken:
`is_owner = request.profile == opportunity.created_by` compares a `Profile` to `Opportunity.created_by`,
which is a `User` foreign key. The two are never equal, so a non-admin who created a deal but did not
also assign it to themselves cannot move it and gets `403` (`kanban_views.py:161-168`). This is one of
the two open `created_by` type-mismatch call sites in this codebase's `opportunity` app; see
[Architecture: Permissions and roles](../architecture/permissions-and-roles.md#object-level-checks)
for the other and for why it hasn't been fixed as part of this documentation task.

## Fields

`OpportunityCreateSerializer.Meta.fields` (`opportunity/serializer.py:270-289`) is what
`POST /api/opportunities/`, `PUT /api/opportunities/{id}/` and `PATCH /api/opportunities/{id}/`
accept. Only `name` is required at the model level (`opportunity/models.py:46`, no `blank=True`).

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | **required** | Unique per org, case-insensitive |
| `account` | uuid | optional | |
| `stage` | one of `STAGES` | optional | Defaults `PROSPECTING`; see [Stages](#stages) |
| `opportunity_type` | one of `OPPORTUNITY_TYPES` | optional | `NEW_BUSINESS`, `EXISTING_BUSINESS`, `RENEWAL`, `UPSELL`, `CROSS_SELL` |
| `currency` | one of `CURRENCY_CODES` | optional | Defaults from the org's `default_currency` if omitted |
| `amount` | decimal | **required if `stage: "CLOSED_WON"`** | Otherwise optional; non-negative (DB constraint) |
| `probability` | integer, 0-100 | optional | Auto-filled from `stage` if `0`/unset. See [Stages](#stages) |
| `closed_on` | date | **required if `stage` is `CLOSED_WON` or `CLOSED_LOST`** | Otherwise optional |
| `lead_source` | one of `SOURCES` | optional | Uppercase, `NONE`, `CALL`, `EMAIL`, `EXISTING CUSTOMER`, `PARTNER`, `PUBLIC RELATIONS`, `CAMPAIGN`, `WEBSITE`, `OTHER`. **Not** `Lead.source`'s `LEAD_SOURCE`. See [Leads](leads.md#list-leads) |
| `description` | text | optional | |
| `is_active` | boolean | optional | Defaults `true` |

Not part of the serializer, but accepted in the same request and resolved by the view (see
[Create an opportunity](#create-an-opportunity)): `contacts`, `tags`, `teams`, `assigned_to` (each a
list of ids, org-scoped), and `opportunity_attachment` (a multipart file).

`GET /api/opportunities/` and `GET /api/opportunities/{id}/` additionally return, but never accept as
input: `id`, `closed_by`, `created_by`, `created_at`, `org` (nested), `created_on_arrow`,
`amount_source` (`MANUAL` or `CALCULATED`, server-derived by `recalculate_amount()` from whether the
deal has line items, `opportunity/models.py:68-73,185-202`; not writable through this serializer),
`stage_changed_at`, `days_in_stage`, `aging_status` (`green`/`yellow`/`red`, from
`Opportunity.get_aging_status()`), `line_items`, `line_items_total`, and `custom_fields` (validated
separately against the org's `CustomFieldDefinition` rows).
