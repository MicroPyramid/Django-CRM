# Cases

Routes in `backend/cases/urls.py`. CRUD and comments/attachments live in `backend/cases/views.py`;
CSV import in `backend/cases/import_views.py` / `backend/cases/services/csv_import.py`; approvals in
`backend/cases/approval_views.py` and `backend/cases/approvals.py`; the knowledge base in
`backend/cases/solution_views.py`. Object-level authorization for the case itself is centralized in
`backend/cases/access.py`; for knowledge-base articles, `backend/cases/kb_access.py`. See
[Conventions](conventions.md) for pagination, filtering and response-shape rules assumed rather than
repeated here, and [Errors](errors.md) for the 404-vs-403 principle referenced below.

Cases are also the largest module in this codebase: Kanban pipelines, merge/unmerge, parent/child
trees, time tracking, escalation, routing, inbound email and analytics all live under
`/api/cases/...` too. This page covers only the endpoints this documentation task scopes: list,
create, detail, comments/attachments, approvals, the knowledge base, and CSV import.

## A case's read, write and delete rules differ on purpose

Before anything else: **do not collapse a case's access rules into one check.** `cases/access.py`
states three explicit, different rules, and its own module docstring explains why, before this
module existed the three verbs had drifted into three different answers by accident, and a watcher's
ticket showed up in their list but answered `403` when they opened it:

```
read    admin · creator · assignee · watcher
write   admin · creator · assignee
delete  admin · creator
```

(`cases/access.py:20-22`.) This is the same "read wide, write narrow" principle
[Architecture: Permissions and roles](../architecture/permissions-and-roles.md#read-wide-write-narrow)
documents in general. That page is the place to read the reasoning; this page just applies it.
Every endpoint under [Retrieve, update, delete](#retrieve-update-delete) and
[Comments and attachments](#comments-and-attachments) calls one of
`assert_case_read_access`/`assert_case_write_access`/`assert_case_delete_access`
(`cases/access.py:90-113`), and the admin check itself is the two-spellings-of-admin form:
`profile.role == "ADMIN" or bool(getattr(profile, "is_admin", False))` (`cases/access.py:38-40`).
That recurs throughout this codebase. **The [Approvals](#approvals) endpoints are the exception**:
`cases/approval_views.py` never imports `cases.access` at all, and none of its case-touching views
call any of the three functions above. See [Approvals](#approvals) for exactly what that means in
practice.

## List cases

`GET /api/cases/` (`CaseListView.get`, `cases/views.py:285-287`) returns one paginated list, ordered
`-created_at, -id` (`:169-174`): a comment on the queryset explains the tiebreak exists because `-id`
alone is a random UUID and was, in practice, no ordering at all. Soft-deleted cases
(`is_active=False`) are excluded by default; an org admin can pass `?include_deleted=true` to see them
(`:176-180`). Merged duplicates (`merged_into` set, or `status="Duplicate"`) are excluded by default
too; `?show_merged=true` includes them (`:181-186`). A non-admin caller sees only cases where they are
creator, assignee, or watcher, the same `visible_cases_qs` the detail view's read check uses
(`:190-198`), so list and detail agree by construction.

```json
{
  "cases_count": 42,
  "offset": 10,
  "cases": [ { "...": "CaseSerializer" } ],
  "status": [["New", "New"], ["Assigned", "Assigned"], ["Pending", "Pending"], ["Closed", "Closed"], ["Rejected", "Rejected"], ["Duplicate", "Duplicate"]],
  "priority": [["Low", "Low"], ["Normal", "Normal"], ["High", "High"], ["Urgent", "Urgent"]],
  "type_of_case": [["Question", "Question"], ["Incident", "Incident"], ["Problem", "Problem"]],
  "open_count": 12,
  "urgent_count": 2,
  "awaiting_first_reply": 5,
  "accounts_list": [ { "...": "AccountSerializer" } ],
  "contacts_list": [ { "...": "ContactSerializer" } ],
  "users": [{"id": "...", "user__email": "..."}]
}
```

(`cases/views.py:222-263`.) `open_count`, `urgent_count` and `awaiting_first_reply` are counted over
the whole filtered queryset, not the page. `awaiting_first_reply` counts open cases
(`status` in `New`/`Assigned`/`Pending`) with no `first_response_at` yet. It is not the same thing as
an SLA breach, which depends on the org's business calendar and is computed per-row rather than in
this aggregate. `accounts_list`/`contacts_list` feed the create form's pickers, org-wide for an admin,
but narrowed to accounts/contacts the caller created or is assigned to for a non-admin, the same split
the case queryset itself gets (`:187-206`); either way they can be heavy, and `?slim=true` omits both
(`:254-256`).

Filters read directly from `request.query_params` (`apply_case_list_filters`, `cases/views.py:85-155`,
shared with `GET /api/cases/watching/`): `name` (contains), `status` (repeatable. A list applies
`status__in`, a single value applies exact match), `priority` (exact), `account` (exact id),
`case_type` (exact), `assigned_to` (repeatable id list), `tags` (id list), `search` (`name` or
`description`, contains), `created_at__gte`/`created_at__lte` (date range), `sla_breached=true`
(a wall-clock approximation of the SLA badge, Postgres-only raw SQL), `cf_<key>` (custom field equals),
and `ordering`: whitelisted to `created_at`, `-created_at`, `priority`, `-priority`, `id`, `-id`,
`name`, `-name` (`:71-82,150-153`); anything else is silently ignored rather than erroring.

## Create a case

`POST /api/cases/` (`CaseListView.post`, `cases/views.py:306-416`) accepts `multipart/form-data` (for
an optional `case_attachment` file) or JSON, validated by `CaseCreateSerializer`
(`cases/serializer.py:139-281`; see [Fields](#fields)). On success (`200`):

```json
{
  "error": false,
  "message": "Case Created Successfully",
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "cases_obj": { "...": "CaseSerializer" }
}
```

A validation failure returns `400` with `{"error": true, "errors": {...}}`. Two validators worth
knowing:

- **`account`, if given, must belong to the caller's org**: `validate_account` rejects a
  cross-tenant id with `"No such account."` (`cases/serializer.py:151-165`); the comment on it notes
  this closes both a cross-tenant *write* and a cross-tenant *read*, since the create response nests
  the account back through `CaseSerializer` → `AccountSerializer`.
- **`name` must be unique per org, case-insensitive** (`validate_name`, `:232-244`).

`contacts`, `teams`, `assigned_to` and `tags` are **not** part of `CaseCreateSerializer`. The view
reads each from the request body after the serializer succeeds, resolved against
`org=request.profile.org` (`:332-386`). Unlike [Leads](leads.md#fields), which documents a real
per-field, per-verb inconsistency in how these four are *parsed*, cases parses all four identically on
every verb: each is `json.loads`'d when it arrives as a string (which happens whenever the same
request also uploads `case_attachment` as multipart) before the id list is extracted. `case_attachment`
itself is read straight off `request.FILES` (`:388-395`): on `POST` only; see
[Retrieve, update, delete](#retrieve-update-delete) for why `PATCH` can't set it at all, and for how
*writing* these four fields (not just parsing them) differs sharply across verbs.

## Retrieve, update, delete

`GET /api/cases/{id}/` (`CaseDetailView.get`, `cases/views.py:612-731`) looks the case up scoped to
the caller's org (`get_case_or_404`, `cases/access.py:57-71`: a malformed UUID or a case in another
org both answer `404`, never `500`, matching [Errors](errors.md#not-found-versus-forbidden)). If the
case has been merged into another one, the response is a redirect hint instead of the case itself:
`{"redirect_to": "<uuid>", "merged_into": "<uuid>", "source_case_id": "<uuid>", "source_case_name": "..."}`,
unless the caller passes `?show_merged=true` (`:614-630`). **This merged-case branch returns before
any read-access check runs at all**; `assert_case_read_access` isn't called until `:633`, several
lines after the merged branch's own `return` at `:630`, so `source_case_name` is disclosed to any org
member who can supply a valid case id, including one with no read access to the case whatsoever, as
long as it happens to be a merged duplicate. On the ordinary, non-merged path, read access genuinely is
checked before the rest of the response body is built (`assert_case_read_access`, `:633`, the comment
on this line notes the previous order built the payload for a case the requester was about to be
refused); it's specifically the merged-redirect shortcut that skips the check entirely. The response nests
the record under `cases_obj`, alongside `attachments`, `comments` (public only), `internal_notes`,
`contacts`, `solutions`, `activities` (last 20), `email_messages` (last 50, inbound-email threads),
`merged_from_cases`, `custom_field_definitions`, `status`, `priority`, `type_of_case`,
`comment_permission` and `users_mention` (`:707-730`). `comment_permission` is computed with the same
`has_case_write_access` the comment-post endpoint enforces (`:642`), so the button a client shows and
the answer the server gives agree by construction, the comment on this line notes that used to not be
true (`comment_permission` was creator-or-admin while the write endpoint below also allowed assignees).

`PUT /api/cases/{id}/` (`:448-570`) and `PATCH /api/cases/{id}/` (`:823-942`) both call
`assert_case_write_access` before touching anything. **`account` cannot be changed by either verb.**
`CaseCreateSerializer.__init__` sets `self.fields["account"].read_only = True` whenever `self.instance`
is set (`cases/serializer.py:146-149`) (true for both update calls, never for create), so on `PUT`/
`PATCH` an `account` in the body is silently dropped before validation ever runs; `validate_account`
never executes and no error is returned. `PUT` is a non-partial serializer instantiation, so it still
requires `name`/`status`/`priority` the same as `POST` does; `PATCH` passes `partial=True`
(`:832`), so none of the three are required there. A `PATCH` may touch just one field.

Closing a case is validated as a *transition*, not just a target value: `CaseCreateSerializer.validate()`
(`cases/serializer.py:167-230`) requires `closed_on` whenever `status` is being set to `"Closed"` from
anything other than `"Closed"`, and, when an active `pre_close` `ApprovalRule` matches the case's
priority/case_type/team. Requires an `Approval` row in state `approved` for that case and rule before
the close is allowed. This exists because `Case.clean()` states the same two rules
(`cases/models.py:180-249`) but `Case.save()` (`:264-283`) never calls `full_clean()`, so without the
serializer-level check a matching rule could be armed and a `PATCH {"status": "Closed"}` would still
return `200` and record zero approvals. Proven live per the comment on `validate()`. Success on either
verb, identical literal string on both (`views.py:564,936`):
`{"error": false, "message": "Case Updated Successfully"}`.

**Three of `Case.clean()`'s parent-tree guards are dead code through the API, and one field that
looks like a partial re-implementation of the model isn't a re-implementation at all.**
`Case.clean()` (`cases/models.py:180-249`) states four rules about `parent`: a case cannot be its own
parent (`:222-223`); linking cannot create a multi-level cycle, walking the whole parent chain to check
(`:226-238`); the tree is capped at `PARENT_MAX_DEPTH = 3` levels (`:178,240-243`); and a case that is
itself `status="Duplicate"` cannot be given a parent at all (`:247-250`, the self-side of the merge
guard, distinct from `parent.status == "Duplicate"`, checked separately at `:245-246`). None of the
four run through any API write, because `Case.save()` (`:264-283`) never calls `full_clean()`. Of the
four, `CaseCreateSerializer.validate_parent()` (`cases/serializer.py:246-263`) independently
re-implements exactly two: the self-parent check, and refusing a parent whose own `status` is
`Duplicate`. **The cycle walk and the depth limit are simply absent from the API, not partially
covered, not approximated, and so is the "a Duplicate case cannot receive a parent" direction.**
`validate_parent()` also rejects a cross-org `parent`, but that check has no model-side counterpart at
all: `Case.clean()` never compares `org_id`, so this is a serializer-only addition, not a partial port
of anything the model already states. Net effect: a same-org, non-self parent assignment that would
create a longer cycle (A's parent is B, then B's parent is set to A), exceed three levels, or give a
merged case a parent, is accepted by every write endpoint today: reported here, not fixed, per this
documentation task's scope.

`DELETE /api/cases/{id}/` (`:586-593`) calls `assert_case_delete_access`, admin or creator only, no
assignee exception (see [above](#a-cases-read-write-and-delete-rules-differ-on-purpose)).

## Comments and attachments

Adding a comment or an attachment is the same `POST /api/cases/{id}/` route the detail endpoint uses,
just with a body (`CaseDetailView.post`, `cases/views.py:749-806`), gated by
`assert_case_write_access` (`:755`). The same rule `comment_permission` on `GET` reports. Send
`comment` (text, and optionally `is_internal`, a truthy string or boolean) and/or `case_attachment`
(multipart file), either or both. A comment created with `is_internal=true` is an internal note, not
visible to a customer-facing surface; the response splits both back out as `comments` (public) and
`internal_notes` (`:794-805`), and both are returned to any caller with read access; `is_internal` is
a display split, not an access-control split on this endpoint.

Editing or deleting an *existing* comment goes through `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/cases/comment/{id}/`
(`CaseCommentView`, `cases/views.py:945-1078`). Restricted to an admin, the `is_organization_admin`
flag (exposed as `.is_admin`, `common/models.py:243-246`: org-scoped, not the platform-level
superuser flag), or the comment's own author (`request.profile == obj.commented_by`, e.g. `:982`).
`Comment.commented_by` is a `Profile` foreign key (`common/models.py:275-277`), so this comparison is
correct, unlike some `created_by` comparisons elsewhere in this codebase; see
[Architecture: Permissions and roles](../architecture/permissions-and-roles.md#object-level-checks).

**`PUT` cannot, in practice, edit a comment.** `.put()` builds `CommentSerializer(obj, data=params)`
with no `partial=True` (`:984`), and `CommentSerializer.Meta.fields` includes `object_id` and `org`
(`common/serializer.py:239-250`). Plain model fields, not declared `read_only` the way `content_type`
and `commented_by` are on the same serializer. A non-partial serializer requires every field that isn't
read-only, so a body of just `{"comment": "..."}`, everything the documented
`CaseCommentEditSwaggerSerializer` contract asks for. Fails validation on the missing `object_id`/
`org` and answers `400`. Only `.patch()` (`partial=True`, `:1028`) can actually change a comment's
text. Separately, because `object_id` and `org` are genuinely writable on `PATCH`, a comment's own
author can send both in a `PATCH` body to repoint the comment at a different record, including one in
another org, or one the author cannot otherwise read. `Comment.clean()`
(`common/models.py:299-314`) checks that the new `org` matches the target record's `org`, and
`Comment.save()` calls `self.full_clean()` (`:316-318`), so a mismatched pair raises Django's
`ValidationError`, uncaught here, as an unhandled `500`; a *matching* cross-org pair (new `org` set to
the target record's real org) saves successfully, leaving a comment authored by a profile from a
different org sitting on that org's record. Neither of these two behaviors is fixed here, reported
per this documentation task's scope.

`DELETE /api/cases/attachment/{id}/` (`CaseAttachmentView.delete`, `cases/views.py:1098-1142`) is
org-scoped (`.filter(pk=pk, org=request.profile.org)`, `:1119-1121`) and its ownership check compares
`request.profile.user_id` to `self.object.created_by_id`, both `User` ids, correctly typed
(`:1128-1130`). The view's own docstring documents two defects that were live in this exact endpoint
before the fix (unscoped lookup; a `Profile`-to-`User` comparison that made the endpoint silently
admin-only). Both are fixed here today. Whether the equivalent endpoint in another app still has
either defect is that app's own question; verify against that app's current source rather than this
docstring, which itself goes stale. See
[Architecture: Permissions and roles](../architecture/permissions-and-roles.md#object-level-checks)
for the current, cross-app answer.

## Approvals

Two kinds of endpoint: admin-configured rules, and per-case requests/decisions against them
(`cases/approval_views.py`). A rule (`ApprovalRule`, `cases/approvals.py:47-116`) matches a case on
`trigger_event` (only `"pre_close"` exists today), and optionally `priority`, `case_type` and `team`.
The most-specific active match wins ties by most recent (`find_matching_rule`, `:119-136`).

- `GET /api/cases/approval-rules/` (`ApprovalRuleListCreateView.get`, `approval_views.py:87-103`).
  Any org member; each rule row carries a `pending_count` computed from the `Approval` log.
- `POST /api/cases/approval-rules/` (`:105-133`), admin only. The approver list and match-team are
  each validated to belong to the caller's org before save (`:117-129`).
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/cases/approval-rules/{id}/` (`ApprovalRuleDetailView`, `:136-194`); `GET` is
  open to any member; `PUT`/`DELETE` are admin only. Deleting a rule with request history soft-disables
  it (`is_active=False`) instead of a hard delete (`:183-192`), since `Approval.rule` is
  `on_delete=PROTECT`.
- `POST /api/cases/{id}/request-approval/` (`CaseRequestApprovalView.post`, `:201-279`), **no case
  access check of any kind.** The view fetches the case with a bare
  `get_object_or_404(Case, id=pk, org=org)` (`:209`), org-scoped, but nothing from `cases.access`;
  `approval_views.py` doesn't import that module at all. Any org member, including one refused the case
  itself with a `403` on `GET /api/cases/{id}/`, can file an approval request against it. The `201`
  response is `ApprovalSerializer(approval).data`, whose `case_summary`
  (`cases/serializer.py:1002-1013`) returns the case's `name`, `status`, `priority` and account name.
  The same read-around `CaseSolutionLinkView` was fixed for (see [Solutions](#solutions)), reintroduced
  here. Also note: because the lookup is `get_object_or_404` rather than the `get_case_or_404` helper
  every other case endpoint on this page uses, a malformed (non-UUID) `id` here isn't a clean `404`;
  `get_object_or_404` only catches `Model.DoesNotExist`, not the `ValidationError`/`ValueError` a bad
  UUID raises against `Case.id`, so it reaches the client as an unhandled `500`, the exact failure mode
  `get_case_or_404` (`cases/access.py:57-71`) exists to prevent elsewhere on this page. Beyond
  existence-and-org-scope, the request is validated against an explicit `rule_id` (which must actively
  match the case) or, when omitted, the best `find_matching_rule` result. A second request against the
  same case+rule while one is already `pending` is refused with `409`, not a duplicate row (`:244-258`).
- `GET /api/cases/approvals/` (`ApprovalInboxView.get`, `:282-341`), the inbox, also with no
  case-level access check: the queryset is `Approval.objects.filter(org=org)` (`:296`), not filtered
  through `visible_cases_qs` or any case-access helper, so a member's `mine=false` inbox view can
  include approval rows, and their `case_summary`, for cases that member has no access to.
  `?state=` filters (default `pending`; `all` drops the filter), `?case=<id>` scopes to one case, and
  `?mine=true` restricts to rows the caller can currently act on (see below), which deliberately
  excludes the caller's own requests, "mine to decide" rather than "mine to have filed" (`:318-332`).
  Neither gap is fixed here, reported per this documentation task's scope.

**Approving and rejecting both enforce that the requester cannot be the approver, with no admin
exception.** `ApprovalApproveView.post` (`:354-407`) and `ApprovalRejectView.post` (`:410-475`) both
check, in order: the approval is still `pending` (else `400`); the caller is in the rule's approver
pool via `can_be_acted_on_by` (else `403`); and, separately,
`approval.requested_by_id == request.profile.id` (else `403`, "You cannot approve/reject your own
request; another approver must decide it.", `:382-390` and `:443-451`). The comment on both is explicit
that this holds even for "an admin who defaults into every rule's pool", being an approver and being
the requester are mutually exclusive for a single decision, regardless of role.
`Approval.can_be_acted_on_by` (`cases/approvals.py:188-196`) itself is: explicitly listed in
`rule.approvers`, **or** `profile.role == rule.approver_role`, note this second clause checks only
`role`, not the `is_organization_admin` flag `is_org_admin` elsewhere in this codebase also treats as
admin, so a profile that is only an admin via that flag is not automatically an approver unless
explicitly added to `rule.approvers`.

`ApprovalSerializer.can_act` and `.is_own_request` (`cases/serializer.py:1045-1062`) mirror the approve
endpoint's checks exactly, so a client rendering the inbox from the list response gets the same answer
the action endpoints would give. Both need `context={"request": request}` to resolve; without it they
default to `False`, which the comment on the serializer notes is the safe default rather than a bug.

`POST /api/cases/approvals/{id}/cancel/` (`ApprovalCancelView.post`, `:478-518`) is a **different**
rule from approve/reject: only the original requester or an admin may cancel (`:498-505`). There is no
"not the requester" restriction here, because cancelling your own request is the ordinary case.

## Solutions

The knowledge base (`cases/solution_views.py`, `cases/kb_access.py`). Read access is org-wide by
design. Every member may read every article, "a knowledge base whose articles are hidden from the
agents answering the tickets is not a knowledge base" (`cases/kb_access.py` module docstring), but
write and release are two different, narrower rules:

```
write     author · admin      title, body, and moving draft ↔ reviewed
release   admin               status → approved, and publish / unpublish
delete    author · admin
```

`release` is deliberately narrower than `write`: the review workflow (`draft → reviewed → approved`,
plus a separate `is_published` flag) only means something if the person who approves an article is not
its own author. `assert_solution_release_access` takes no article argument at all. Being the author is
the one thing that must not grant it (`cases/kb_access.py:72-81`).

`GET /api/cases/solutions/` (`SolutionListView.get`, `cases/solution_views.py:88-142`) is the one
endpoint in this API that calls DRF's `get_paginated_response()` and returns its standard
`count`/`next`/`previous`/`results` envelope, [Conventions](conventions.md#pagination) names this
exact endpoint as the sole example. It adds one extra top-level key, `totals`
(`count`/`published`/`draft`/`reviewed`/`approved_unpublished`), computed over the *whole* knowledge
base rather than the current filter, so the four status cards stay meaningful under a `?status=`
filter (`:122-134`). Filters: `?status=`, `?is_published=` (accepts `true`/`1`/`yes`/`on`, not just the
literal string `"true"`), `?search=` (title or description, contains).

`POST /api/cases/solutions/` (`:150-167`) is open to any member for an ordinary draft, but is gated by
`assert_solution_release_access` the moment the payload would create an already-`approved` or
already-`is_published` article in one request (`_wants_release`, `:28-46`): without this, an author
could write and publish an article in a single `POST`, bypassing the review workflow entirely.

`GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/cases/solutions/{id}/` (`SolutionDetailView`, `:170-237`): `GET` is open to
any member; `PUT`/`PATCH` require `assert_solution_write_access` (author or admin) plus, again,
`assert_solution_release_access` if the request would move the article to `approved` or flip
`is_published`; `DELETE` requires the same write rule (not a separate, narrower one. Deleting your own
draft is ordinary tidying).

`POST /api/cases/solutions/{id}/publish/` and `POST /api/cases/solutions/{id}/unpublish/`
(`SolutionPublishView`/`SolutionUnpublishView`, `:240-295`) both require
`assert_solution_release_access`. Publishing additionally requires `status == "approved"` (`400`
otherwise); the comment on the unpublish view is explicit that pulling a bad answer down is the *same*
switch as giving it to customers and therefore gated the same way, even though the urgency argument
runs the other direction.

Reading which solutions are linked to a case is not a separate endpoint. The linked set is returned
as part of `GET /api/cases/{id}/` (`solutions` key, [above](#retrieve-update-delete)). Linking is
`POST /api/cases/{id}/solutions/` and unlinking is `DELETE /api/cases/{id}/solutions/{solution_id}/`
(`CaseSolutionLinkView`, `cases/views.py:1145-1208`), gated by `assert_case_write_access` on the
*case*: the comment on `.post` notes this closes a read-around: before this check, a member refused a
case with `403` could still link an article to it and then read the case's name, description, account
and contacts back out through that article's own `linked_cases`. The read side of the same gap is
closed in `cases/solution_serializers.py`'s `SolutionDetailSerializer.get_linked_cases`, which filters
the cases it returns through the same `visible_cases_qs` the case list and detail views use, rather
than returning every case the article happens to be linked to.

## CSV import

Two endpoints, gated to org admins or members with `has_sales_access` (`_can_import`,
`cases/import_views.py:23-31`). Anyone else gets `403`.

`POST /api/cases/import/preview/` (`CaseImportPreviewView`, `import_views.py:56-88`) reads a
`multipart/form-data` upload in a field named `file` (`.csv` extension required). The 5 MB cap is
checked against `upload.size`, Django's reported size for the uploaded file, available before
`.read()` is called, **not** the bytes actually read, and the check is skipped entirely when
`upload.size` is falsy (`if upload.size and upload.size > MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, `import_views.py:48-51`).
It then validates every row without writing anything. Row numbers are 1-based over *data* rows, not
file lines. The header itself is never counted, so the first row of data is `"row": 1`
(`enumerate(data_rows, start=1)` over `rows[1:]`, `services/csv_import.py:216-217`):

```json
{
  "header_error": null,
  "valid": [

`POST /api/cases/import/commit/` (`CaseImportCommitView`, `:91-125`) re-validates the same file and
writes every valid row inside one transaction, **if any row fails validation, nothing is written**
(`services/csv_import.py` `commit_rows`, "Don't write anything if any row failed; users must fix the
file first"). On success (`200`): `{"error": false, "created": 12, "ids": ["<uuid>", "..."]}`.

Required headers: `name`, `status`, `priority`. Recognized optional headers: `description`,
`case_type`, `account_name`, `contact_emails`, `assigned_emails`, `team_names`, `tags`, `closed_on`
(`REQUIRED_HEADERS`/`OPTIONAL_HEADERS`, `services/csv_import.py:36-46`), an unknown header, or a
missing required one, fails the whole file with `header_error` before any row is checked.
`contact_emails`, `assigned_emails` and `team_names` accept `;`-separated multiple values per cell and
must resolve to an existing contact/active member/team in the caller's org, or the row errors
(`:396-438`). `status`/`priority`/`case_type` are matched case-insensitively against the same choice
sets [Fields](#fields) documents for the API proper. A case name must be unique per org, checked
against both existing cases and other rows earlier in the same file (`:338-355`). The file is capped
at 5,000 data rows (`MAX_ROWS`, `:49`).

## Fields

`CaseCreateSerializer.Meta.fields` (`cases/serializer.py:265-281`) is what `POST /api/cases/`,
`PUT /api/cases/{id}/` and `PATCH /api/cases/{id}/` accept. "Required" below means required on
`POST` and on `PUT` (which is non-partial); `PATCH` passes `partial=True`, so nothing is required
there: see [Retrieve, update, delete](#retrieve-update-delete).

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string, max 64 | **required** (POST/PUT) | Unique per org, case-insensitive |
| `status` | one of `STATUS_CHOICE` | **required** (POST/PUT) | `New`, `Assigned`, `Pending`, `Closed`, `Rejected`, `Duplicate` |
| `priority` | one of `PRIORITY_CHOICE` | **required** (POST/PUT) | `Low`, `Normal`, `High`, `Urgent` |
| `case_type` | one of `CASE_TYPE` | optional | `Question`, `Incident`, `Problem` |
| `closed_on` | date | **required when closing** | See [Retrieve, update, delete](#retrieve-update-delete); optional otherwise |
| `description` | text | optional | |
| `is_active` | boolean | optional | Defaults `true`; soft-delete flag, hidden from `GET /api/cases/` by default |
| `account` | uuid | optional on create; **write-once** | Must belong to the caller's org; silently `read_only` on `PUT`/`PATCH`. See [Retrieve, update, delete](#retrieve-update-delete) |
| `custom_fields` | object | optional | Validated against the org's `CustomFieldDefinition` rows |
| `parent` | uuid | optional | Same-org, non-self, parent not `Duplicate`; see the dead model-level guards [above](#retrieve-update-delete) |
| `is_problem` | boolean | optional | Defaults `false`; marks an ITIL "problem" (umbrella) ticket |
| `org` |. | **read-only** | Server-derived from `request.profile.org`; listed in `Meta.fields` but not writable |

Not part of the serializer, but accepted in the same request body and resolved by the view (each a
list of ids, org-scoped): `contacts`, `teams`, `assigned_to`, `tags`. Parsing is identical on every
verb (see [Create a case](#create-a-case)), but *writing* is not, and the difference is a real
data-loss trap: `POST` only ever adds. `PUT` calls `.clear()` on all four M2Ms **unconditionally**,
before checking whether the request even mentioned them (`views.py:485,501,515,531`), so a `PUT`
that omits `assigned_to` from the body unassigns every assignee on the case, not just leaves them
unchanged. `PATCH` clears a given M2M only when its key is present in the body at all
(`if "assigned_to" in params:`, `:903`, and identically for the other three). Omitting a key on
`PATCH` genuinely leaves it untouched. `case_attachment` (a multipart file) is accepted on `POST` and
`PUT` (`views.py:388,545`) but **not on `PATCH`**; `CaseDetailView.patch` never reads
`request.FILES` at all, so a multipart `PATCH` carrying `case_attachment` silently drops the file with
no error.

`GET /api/cases/{id}/` and `GET /api/cases/` additionally return, but never accept as input: `id`,
`created_by`, `created_at`, `escalation_count`, `last_escalation_fired_at`, the SLA fields
(`sla_first_response_hours`, `sla_resolution_hours`, `first_response_at`, `resolved_at`,
`sla_paused_at`, `first_response_sla_deadline`, `resolution_sla_deadline`,
`is_sla_first_response_breached`, `is_sla_resolution_breached`), `parent_summary`, `child_count`, and
`time_summary` (`CaseSerializer.Meta.fields`, `cases/serializer.py:97-136`).
