**BottleCRM is an open source CRM you run on your own infrastructure.** It covers the full
customer lifecycle: leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities, support tickets, tasks and
invoices: through a SvelteKit web app, a native Flutter mobile app, and a documented REST API
sharing one Django backend. PostgreSQL Row-Level Security isolates each organization's data at
the database layer, so a single deployment serves one startup or hundreds of tenants.

No per-seat pricing, no user caps, no feature paywall. MIT licensed: fork it, self-host it, own
your data.

## Why BottleCRM

- **Free forever, MIT licensed**: unlimited users and records, no subscription. A genuinely
  self-hosted CRM alternative to Salesforce, HubSpot and Pipedrive.
- **Multi-tenant by design**: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security enforces tenant isolation in the
  database, not just in application code. Run it for a single company or as a SaaS for many.
- **Agent-ready REST API**: point Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini or any agent at the API with a
  personal access token and let it search, create and update records *as you*, inheriting your
  role, org and permissions. An OpenAPI schema ships with it, so the agent can discover the
  endpoints itself.
- **Web, native mobile and API**: one Django REST backend behind a Svelte 5 web app and a
  Flutter app for iOS and Android.
- **A stack you can actually hack on**: Django 6 / DRF and Svelte 5, not a bespoke in-house
  framework. If your team writes Python, it can extend this on day one.
- **Real support tooling**: a full helpdesk with SLA timers, approvals, escalations, macros and
  a knowledge base, not a bolted-on ticket list.
