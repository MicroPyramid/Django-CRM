#### System Requirements

sudo apt install postgresql xvfb libfontconfig wkhtmltopdf git libpq-dev python3-dev python3-pip gem ruby ruby-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-venv redis-server redis-tools virtualenv -y

sudo gem install sass

sudo apt-get install postfix

```

#### postfix package installation process
* After running ```sudo apt-get install postfix``` in terminal, select ```Internet``` as a configuration from the pop-up and click ok. Next it will ask to enter the ```System mail name``` which will be the used as a ```From Email Address``` during sending the mail.

#### Install dependencies
---

* Create and activate a virtual environment.

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install the project's dependencie

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### env variables
* Then refer to `env.md` for environment variables and keep those in the `.env` file in the current folder as your project is in.
* Add ```127.0.0.1   test.localhost``` to your hosts file ```/etc/hosts```. Then you can use test as company name to register and login.

#### next steps
```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your borwser and create a new account with test as company name. We mapped `test.localhost` to `127.0.0.1`. So, it should work properly.
