/**
 * What an inbound address actually does with mail, as opposed to what its
 * on/off switch says.
 *
 * `is_active` is one of three gates a delivery has to clear, and the page used
 * to draw it as the only one: an address was either "Creating tickets" or
 * "Creating nothing". Two states were drawn as the first and behave as the
 * second, both silently, because inbound mail has no user watching it fail:
 *
 * 1. **An unimplemented provider.** `InboundMailbox.PROVIDER_CHOICES` offers
 *    four, and `InboundMailboxWebhookView.post` answers 501 for every one that
 *    is not `ses`. A Mailgun address marked active accepts mail and opens
 *    nothing, forever, and the form offered the four as equals.
 * 2. **An unpinned SES address.** The webhook needs both a valid SNS signature
 *    and a `topic_arn` that matches this mailbox, because a signature alone
 *    only proves the message came from *some* topic in *some* AWS account. A
 *    mailbox acquires its pin from the first signature-verified
 *    SubscriptionConfirmation, so between "added here" and "subscribed in AWS"
 *    it rejects everything.
 *
 * The states are ordered as the webhook itself checks them, so `deliveryState`
 * answers "which gate does a delivery fail first", and an address that clears
 * all three is the only one called live. Nothing here is a security control:
 * every gate is enforced in `cases/inbound_views.py`, and this only decides
 * what the page says about it.
 *
 * `mobile/lib/data/models/mailbox.dart` carries the same rules.
