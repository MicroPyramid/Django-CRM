   * The settings hub.
   *
   * v1 has thirteen settings routes reachable only from a dropdown, so nobody
   * could tell what was configurable without opening each one. This lists them
   * with the current value beside each. A settings index that does not tell
   * you the current state is a table of contents, not a screen.
   *
   * Grouped by what a setting decides, not by which Django app owns it:
   * "who a ticket lands on" and "what closes it" belong together whether or
   * not they live in the same models file.
   *
   * `warn` is the second reason this page exists. Each destination reports
   * whether something there needs attention, so the hub is worth opening even
   * when you did not come to change anything. A warning here always has a
   * matching explanation on the page it points to, never a badge that leads
   * to a screen with nothing on it.
   *
   * Destinations v2 has not built are listed anyway and link to v1, marked as
   * such. An index that quietly omits settings is worse than one that admits
   * where they live: people go looking, find nothing, and conclude the feature
   * does not exist.
