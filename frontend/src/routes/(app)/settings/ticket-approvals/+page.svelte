  /**
   * What gates a ticket close, and who can clear it.
   *
   * The queue at /v2/tickets/approvals answers "what is waiting on me". This
   * answers "what will be gated next time, and by whom", the same rows, a
   * different question, which is why it is a settings page and not a tab.
   *
   * Three states the model permits and the form does not warn about, all
   * flagged on the row here. See `./matching.js`, which owns the rules:
   *
   * - approver_role MANAGER with no named approvers. Profile.role is only
   *   ADMIN or USER, so the rule matches nobody and what it gates can never be
   *   closed by anyone.
   * - Two active rules with identical conditions. Only one rule gates a given
   *   ticket, and among equals the newest takes every case, so the older is
   *   dead however live it looks.
   * - Named approvers read as a narrowing and are a widening: anyone holding
   *   the role clears the rule too.
   *
   * Separation of duties, an admin clearing their own requested close, is
   * NOT a gap to warn about: `ApprovalApproveView` rejects an approval whose
   * requester is the approver, unconditionally (no admin exception), so the API
   * enforces it however a rule is configured. An earlier version of this page
   * flagged "any admin, including the requester" as a hole; the view has since
   * closed it, so the warning is gone.
