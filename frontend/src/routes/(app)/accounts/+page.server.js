 * Only filters the API actually applies are forwarded. A parameter that
 * changes the URL and nothing else teaches people the filter bar is decorative.
 *
 * `city` and `industry` used to be forwarded straight off the URL, unvalidated
 * as anything the API happened to read; they now go through `readFilters`
 * like every other v2 list, so a hand-typed param never becomes a variable
 * this layer carries and an `industry` value outside the option list gets
 * dropped rather than returning a silent empty page.
 *
 * The pickers are fetched here rather than inside `listAccounts` for the same
 * reason as `leads.js`: folding them into the list read would cost every
 * other caller of that function a request it never renders.
