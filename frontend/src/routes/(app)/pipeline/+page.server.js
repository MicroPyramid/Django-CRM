/**
 * The list and the board are two different queries, not two renderings of one
 * result: the table is paginated and the board is grouped and capped per
 * column. Only the one being shown is fetched.
 *
 * `view` is read and forwarded untouched. It is the board/list layout toggle,
 * not a filter, and must survive every preset and chip link the same way it
 * did before this page grew a filter bar.
 *
 * `open` and `rotten` are preset-only params, the same shape as `all` on
 * /tickets and /tasks: `?open=true` narrows to the working pipeline and
 * `?rotten=true` to the stalled subset (`opportunity_views.py:183,186`), and
 * neither is one of the descriptor's `fields`, only its `presets`, so
 * `readFilters` does not carry them and this load reads them off the URL
 * itself. Neither is offered on the board (see BOARD_PRESETS below): the
 * kanban endpoint does not read either one.
 *
 * `BOARD_FIELDS` and `BOARD_PRESETS` say what the board can actually run, and
 * live in `deals.js` rather than here. A `+page.server.js` may export only a
 * fixed set of names, and SvelteKit answers 500 for the whole route on any
 * other one.
