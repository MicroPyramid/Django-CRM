 *
 * `inactive=1` in the URL is kept from the fixture page, because the question
 * it asks is a good one, but it is answered by the API now (`?is_active=`)
 * rather than by discarding rows after they arrive, which was only ever right
 * on the first page.
 *
 * The pickers are fetched here rather than inside `listContacts` for the same
 * reason as `tickets.js`: a picker fetch folded into the list read would cost
 * a redundant request on every caller that reads contacts for their totals
 * alone.
