/**
 * The invoice list.

 * Server load, so the JWT cookie stays server-side. Rows arrive from one API
 * call, filtered by whatever `FILTER_FIELDS` params are on the URL. The
 * header pills do NOT narrow with them, see the note on `totals` in
 * `listInvoices` (`$lib/server/v2/invoices.js`): the API computes them over
 * the role-scoped queryset before filtering, by design, so this page has no
 * "these numbers describe the filtered list" line the way accounts, estimates,
 * tasks, tickets and pipeline do. Adding one here would describe something
 * that is not true for this endpoint.
 *
 * The owner and account pickers are separate fetches, same reasoning as
 * leads.js and pipeline's deals.js: folding them into `listInvoices` would
 * cost every other caller of that function (the shell's nav badge, for one) a
 * request it never renders.
