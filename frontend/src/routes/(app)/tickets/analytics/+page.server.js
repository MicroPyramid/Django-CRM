 * The service-analytics dashboard. `load` returns `{ can_view, totals, volume,
 * firstResponse, byType, byAgent }`. The exact fields the page reads. The
 * dashboard is admin-only; for a non-admin `can_view` is false and the figures
 * are an empty, valid shape, so the page shows its "admins only" state instead
 * of a personal slice under org-wide headings.
 *
 * An optional `?days=` narrows the window (the backend clamps it to 1-90);
 * absent, it defaults to the last 14 days. A `?days=` that is not a number is
 * dropped here rather than forwarded: the API refuses it, correctly, and a
 * hand-edited URL should land on the default window rather than on an error
 * page.
