/**
 * Closing a parent ticket, and what goes with it.
 *
 * `POST /cases/<id>/close-with-children/` closes the ticket and, when
 * `cascade` is true, every OPEN DESCENDANT of it. This module works out which
 * tickets those are, so the confirm step can name them before anything is
 * closed.
 *
 * **The tree endpoint does not return the ticket you are closing.** `GET
 * /cases/<id>/tree/` walks UP to the highest ancestor in the org and returns
 * that as `root`, with `focus_id` naming the ticket you asked about. So the
 * subtree that will actually be closed has to be found inside the response
 * first. A previous version of this feature (`CloseWithChildrenDialog.svelte`,
 * written, never wired to a button, deleted with this change) walked from
 * `root` and collected every open node except the focus. For a ticket that is
 * itself a child that listed its parent, its siblings and its cousins as
 * about to be closed, and none of them would have been. Overstating the blast
 * radius of a destructive action is worse than saying nothing.
 *
 * [openDescendants] mirrors `_open_descendants` in `cases/parent_views.py`
 * exactly, including the two things that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - a node counts only when it is open AND active, and
 * - recursion goes through closed nodes anyway, so an open grandchild under a
 *   closed child is still cascaded.
