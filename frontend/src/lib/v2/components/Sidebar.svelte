  /**
   * One flat tree, grouped by what the person is doing rather than by which
   * Django app owns the model. Every label matches the route it lands on and
   * the page title it lands on; "Pipeline" goes to /v2/pipeline, which is
   * titled "Pipeline".
   *
   * v1 had /leads listed twice, as "Pipeline" and as "Leads", and a "Deals"
   * entry pointing at /opportunities while /deals 404'd.
   *
   * `role` is server-derived from the JWT (see the app layout loader). It only
   * decides which destinations to *show*. Every hidden one is still enforced
   * by the backend, so this is UX, not access control. An item marked `admin`
   * is one where a member gets nothing but a "for administrators" gate, so
   * showing it would only teach them to bounce off it.
   *
   * `termKey` marks the handful of entity destinations a vertical pack may
   * relabel (see `$lib/terminology.js`). The string in `label` below is only
   * ever the fallback an org with no pack, or no override for that key,
   * still renders; the derived `groups` below is what actually resolves it
   * against `terminology`. No other label branches on the org at all.
   *
