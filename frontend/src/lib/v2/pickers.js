/**
 * Keeping a stored target that the picker list cannot offer.
 *
 * Every people picker on the settings pages is built from
 * `getOrgPeopleAndTeams`, and `GetTeamsAndUsersView` filters profiles to
 * `is_active=True, org=request.profile.org`. None of the four `cases` settings
 * resources filter `is_active` on the write side, so a profile that was a
 * legal target when it was chosen stays the stored target after it is
 * deactivated. The list the form renders from can no longer represent it.
 *
 * A `<select>` whose bound value matches no option reports
 * `selectedIndex === -1`, and a select with no selected option contributes NO
 * entry to `FormData`. The action then reads that absence as `''` and the
 * body builder turns `''` into `null`. So an admin who opens an edit form to
 * change something unrelated, and saves, silently clears a target they never
 * touched. On an escalation policy that means Urgent breaches stop escalating
 * to anybody, with no message anywhere.
 *
 * The fix is to give the select something to match: render the stored value as
 * its own option, labelled so the admin can see why it is there. That is what
 * these two helpers find. They live in `$lib/v2/` rather than `$lib/server/v2/`
 * because a `.svelte` file cannot import from `$lib/server/`, and here they can
 * still be unit tested, unlike the markup that consumes them.
 *
 * "Not in the list" is the test, not "is_active is false": the pages that need
 * this do not receive `is_active` on a stored target, and absence from a list
 * that only ever contains active in-org profiles means the same thing. The one
 * case where it means something else is a failed picker fetch, which
 * `getOrgPeopleAndTeams` reports as empty lists; the form is unusable then
 * anyway, and keeping the stored value is still the right outcome.
