/**
 * Accounts: the third v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Same rules as `leads.js` and `deals.js`: this file lives under `$lib/server`
 * because SvelteKit refuses to bundle that directory into client code and the
 * access token is an httpOnly cookie. The org is never a parameter; it is a
 * claim inside the JWT and the backend reads it from there.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE, AND WHY NOW
 * `/pipeline` went live linking each deal to `/accounts/{uuid}`, and
 * `/accounts` was still fixtures keyed by slugs like `acc-northwind`. So
 * every account link on a live page answered 404. A module is not finished
 * when its own pages work; it is finished when the pages it points at do.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE FIXTURES CAME OFF
 * - `renewal_note` ("Renews every August", "Prospect, no contract yet") is
 *   gone. There is no contract, subscription or renewal model anywhere in the
 *   backend, and nothing to derive one from. A renewal date is the kind of
 *   invention somebody plans a quarter around.
 * - `customer_since` is gone as a stored fact and comes back as `first_won_on`
 *: the close date of the first deal won against this company, which the CRM
 *   does know. The page still says "customer since"; the field name says where
 *   the date came from.
 * - `billing_city` / `billing_country` are `city` / `country_display`. Account
 *   has one flat address, not a billing and a shipping one.
 * - `employees` is `number_of_employees`.
 * - A contact's `relationship` ("Champion", "Blocker") is gone for the third
 *   time; Contact has `title` and `department`.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIXTURE GOT RIGHT
 * The mock refused to store `lifetime_value` / `open_pipeline` /
 * `overdue_amount` and derived them from the records instead, with a comment
 * saying the real API had to aggregate them in SQL. It does now,
 * `accounts.views.annotate_rollups`, one correlated subquery per figure.
 *
 * NUMBERS ARRIVE AS STRINGS
 * DRF renders `DecimalField` as a string. The rollups come through the JSON
 * encoder as numbers, the model fields as strings, and the pages add them
 * together, so everything numeric is coerced here, at the boundary.
