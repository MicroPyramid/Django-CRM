 * were wrong with it. A cross-origin `<a href>` carries neither the JWT nor
 * the SvelteKit session cookie, so the link 403s for the person who is
 * allowed to open the file; and where it does resolve, `/media/` is guarded
 * only by "has an org context", which is every signed-in user of every
 * tenant. The link was broken for its owner and open to everybody else.
 *
 * So the client never sees a storage path. It gets a route on this origin,
 * which streams the file from an authenticated backend endpoint that checks
 * the record's own read predicate first.
