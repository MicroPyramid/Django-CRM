/**
 * Settings hub: the wiring behind `/settings`.
 *
 * Server-only. The hub summarises every settings destination, so it needs a
 * number from each. Rather than a bespoke `/settings/summary/` endpoint, which
 * would have to reproduce, in Python across eight apps, the per-destination
 * rollups the pages already derive (escalation's "breaches going nowhere",
 * inbound's "silently dropping"). This fans out to the same server layers each
 * sub-page uses and assembles their totals. The calls run concurrently, so the
 * hub costs one round of parallel requests, not a dozen sequential ones.
 *
 * People, API tokens and the reopen policy are admin-only: their endpoints 403
 * a member. `listTeam` / `listOrgTokens` already fold that into a `forbidden`
 * sentinel; the reopen fetch throws, so it is caught below. Either way the hub
 * still lists those destinations for a member. It just omits the value and any
 * warning it cannot compute, the same way the shell omits the team badge a
 * member cannot count. Every other destination is readable by any member, so a
 * throw from one of those is a real failure and is left to propagate.
