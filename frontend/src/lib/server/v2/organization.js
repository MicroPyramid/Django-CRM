/**
 * Organization settings: the eleventh v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Lives under `$lib/server` like the ten before it: the JWT cookie stays
 * server-side and org is a token claim, never a parameter. `GET/PATCH
 * /api/org/settings/` always acts on `request.profile.org`. There is no org id
 * in the URL, so a caller can only ever read or edit their OWN org. That is the
 * tenant barrier; there is nothing to scope by hand.
 *
 * WHAT THE SETTINGS PAGE READS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT
 * The company profile (printed on invoices), locale defaults, and two org-wide
 * case-handling switches. It never touches the org API key: that credential
 * authenticates as the org's first admin, so it is excluded from
 * `OrgSettingsSerializer` entirely and rotated only through `OrgApiKeyView`.
 * `is_active` (the org kill switch) is likewise not editable here.
 *
 * THE BACKEND GAP THIS WIRING CLOSED
 * `csat_enabled` and `auto_close_children_on_parent_close` are real `Org`
 * columns that had no write path through ANY serializer, the settings page
 * displayed them but nothing could change them. They are now in the writable
 * allow-list. (A second, older `OrgUpdateView` at `/api/org/<id>/` writes only
 * `name` and silently drops every other field; this page deliberately uses
 * `/api/org/settings/`, the serializer-based endpoint, and not that one.)
 *
 * ADMIN-ONLY EDIT, MEMBER-VISIBLE READ
 * GET is open to any member. The company profile is not a secret, and members
 * legitimately see their org's address and currency. PATCH is admin-only,
 * enforced by the backend (403 for a non-admin). `can_edit` here is a display
 * hint decoded from the JWT `role` claim; the server is what actually refuses.
