/**
 * Tickets: the fifth v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Same rules as `leads.js`, `deals.js`, `accounts.js` and `contacts.js`: this
 * file lives under `$lib/server` because SvelteKit refuses to bundle that
 * directory into client code and the access token is an httpOnly cookie. The
 * org is never a parameter; it is a claim inside the JWT and the backend reads
 * it from there.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE, AND WHY NOW
 * `/tickets` is the most-linked unwired prefix in the app. The account page
 * and the contact page both list a customer's tickets, and both had to render
 * them as plain text because `/tickets/<uuid>` answered 404. The fixtures
 * were keyed on `'421'`. Timesheet rows, the approvals queue and every
 * notification about a case point here too.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE FIXTURES CAME OFF
 * - `#421` is gone. There is no ticket number. `Case` has a UUID and nothing
 *   else to call itself by, so the "#" column, the crumb and the "also open
 *   here" rail were all printing a field that does not exist. The subject is
 *   the identifier; the pages say so instead of numbering them.
 * - `first_response_target_minutes` is gone, and the fixture's note that it
 *   "models the escalation policy" had the schema backwards:
 *   `EscalationPolicy.first_response_target` is a **Profile** to notify on a
 *   breach, not a duration. The target lives on the case itself as
 *   `sla_first_response_hours`, and the deadline the backend computes from it
 *   (`first_response_sla_deadline`) walks the org's business calendar and
 *   pushes forward by any time the ticket sat in Pending. That is a better
 *   number than the wall-clock arithmetic the mock page was doing, so the
 *   deadline is taken from the server and not recomputed here.
 * - `next_action` is gone for the fifth time. Nothing on Case suggests what to
 *   do next; the page says what is true: unanswered, waiting on the customer,
 *   nobody assigned, and leaves the advice out.
 * - `contact` (one name) is really `contacts`, a many-to-many. A ticket can be
 *   raised by nobody, or name three people.
 * - The mock's "Suggested articles" rail is now the articles actually **linked**
 *   to this ticket (`Case.solutions`). Suggestions are a different endpoint
 *   (`/<id>/solution-suggestions/`) doing keyword matching, and calling
 *   something a suggestion when it is a filed link would misread the rail.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIXTURE GOT RIGHT
 * That the queue's job is to say what to open next, and that a first-reply
 * clock is the thing that decides it. It just measured it against a field
 * nothing in the codebase ever wrote. See `cases/signals.py`.
