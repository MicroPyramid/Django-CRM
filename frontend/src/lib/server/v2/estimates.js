/**
 * Estimates: the fifteenth v2 module wired to the real API, and the second of
 * the invoices sub-pages (after products).
 *
 * Same rules as the fourteen before it: this file lives under `$lib/server`
 * because the access token is an httpOnly cookie SvelteKit refuses to bundle
 * into client code. The org is never a parameter; it is a claim in the JWT and
 * the backend reads it from there.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE
 * The estimates worklist has one job: surface money the customer has already
 * agreed to and nobody has billed. An estimate that is `Accepted` and not yet
 * converted, and let a rep raise the invoice in one click. The fixture faked
 * both the list and that action. Wiring them turns "Raise invoice" into a real
 * `convert` call that lands on the new draft.
 *
 * WHAT THE WIRING NEEDED FROM THE BACKEND
 * The list serializer omitted the two facts the worklist turns on,
 * `converted_to_invoice` and `opportunity`, so a row could not say whether it
 * had already been billed. Reading fixtures, every accepted estimate looked
 * unbilled, so the page would have offered to raise a *second* invoice for one
 * that already had one. Those two fields were added to `EstimateListSerializer`
 * (read-only, id + one label each) rather than papered over here.
 *
 * TOTALS ARE COMPUTED HERE, NOT ON THE WIRE
 * The estimate list endpoint has no `totals` envelope (unlike invoices). The
 * four header figures are derived from the loaded rows, so they cover the same
 * set the table shows: the requester's, which the API already scopes (an admin
 * sees the org, a member sees their own and assigned). At more than 1000
 * estimates the derived figures would cover only the first page; the list is
 * requested with `limit=1000` and that ceiling is called out where it is set.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS DEFERRED
 * Creating an estimate from scratch is a builder: header, three FK pickers and
 * a line-item table, the same class of surface as the invoice builder (#48),
 * not a sub-page's worth of work. In this product an estimate is raised from a
 * deal, which is what the page's empty state has always said, so "New estimate"
 * points at the pipeline rather than a form this change would only half-build.
