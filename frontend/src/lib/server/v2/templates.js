/**
 * Invoice templates: the eighteenth v2 module and the highest-risk of the
 * invoices sub-pages. Server-only, like every v2 module: the access token is an
 * httpOnly cookie and the org is a JWT claim the backend reads, never a param.
 *
 * WHAT A TEMPLATE IS, AND WHY THIS PAGE IS CAREFUL
 * A template is org-wide shared config: how every invoice looks when it reaches
 * a customer. `template_html` / `template_css` are org-authored HTML/CSS that
 * WeasyPrint renders into a PDF on the SERVER. They must never reach this app's
 * DOM: the moment either lands in a `{@html}` a PDF setting becomes stored XSS.
 * The backend list/detail serializer now strips both fields (a `has_custom_html`
 * boolean and a byte count stand in for them), so, unlike the old mock, which
 * omitted the blobs at the client boundary. The markup never leaves the DB in
 * the first place. `toRow` whitelists fields anyway, as a second wall.
 *
 * THE FINDING THIS MODULE CARRIED
 * Both template endpoints were `(IsAuthenticated, HasOrgContext)` only: any
 * member could create, edit, delete, or re-point the org default, and could
 * write raw `template_html`/`template_css` that feeds the server-side PDF
 * render. That was fixed on the backend (admin-only writes + a `url_fetcher`
 * that stops the WeasyPrint SSRF/local-file-read); this page is the client that
 * draws the one write a worklist should own.
 *
 * THE WRITES: SET DEFAULT, CREATE, EDIT
 * `is_default` is a singleton, the model clears it on every other row inside a
 * transaction, so making a template the default is a swap, not a toggle. It is
 * owned by the list page's "Use instead of" control and deliberately absent
 * from the edit form, so that saving an unrelated change can never demote the
 * org's default by submitting an unchecked box.
 *
 * Editing used to be impossible rather than merely unwired: the detail GET
 * answers with the same stripping serializer as the list, so a form could not
 * pre-fill the two fields it exists to change, and saving would have blanked
 * them. `GET /invoices/templates/<id>/editor/` now serves the raw markup on its
 * own admin-only route, which is what `getInvoiceTemplateForEdit` reads. The
 * detail and list responses are unchanged and still strip both fields.
 *
 * The markup is bound to `<textarea>` values, never to `{@html}`. That rule is
 * what makes serving it safe, and it is the one thing a future edit to these
 * pages must not break.
 *
 * TOTALS ARE COMPUTED HERE
 * The list endpoint has no `totals` envelope. `count` comes from the response;
 * `unused` (templates no invoice uses and that are not the default. Safe to
 * delete) is derived from the rows. `limit=1000`; an org has a handful of
 * templates, and that ceiling is called out where it is set.

 * Create an invoice template.

 * `profile.role` is not ADMIN and who is not a superuser. The page hides the
 * control using `can_manage`, but that is a display hint decoded from the JWT;
 * the backend re-derives the role and is the check that matters.
 *
 * The colour checks below now mirror `_validate_hex_color` in
 * `InvoiceTemplateCreateSerializer`, which is the check that counts. They used
 * to mirror nothing: the model is `max_length=7` and had no format validator,
 * so `"purple"` was stored happily and then rendered as an invalid CSS colour
 * in the PDF. The serializer closed that when the phone became the third client
 * constraining the field. These stay because a client-side message beats a raw
 * 400 on a field the user picked from a swatch.
 *
 * `is_default` is not a plain field write: the model's `save()` clears the flag
 * on every other template in the org inside a transaction, so setting it here
 * demotes whichever template is currently default.
 *
 * When a logo is supplied the body must be multipart, because `logo` is an
 * ImageField. `apiRequest` already detects a `FormData` body and leaves
 * `Content-Type` unset so the browser adds the boundary.
 *
 * `InvoiceTemplateListView.post` (`backend/invoices/api_views.py`) wraps its
 * result in an envelope, `{ error, message, template }`, exactly the trap
 * `createTag` documents in `tags.js`: a `create*` function that resolves to
 * the envelope instead of the record is the one the next caller reaches for
 * `.id` on and gets `undefined`. This unwraps to `.template` deliberately,
 * with the same `?? resp` fallback as `createTag`, so a change in the
 * backend's response shape degrades to the raw envelope rather than throwing.
