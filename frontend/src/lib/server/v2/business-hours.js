/**
 * Business hours: the wiring behind `/settings/business-hours`.
 *
 * Server-only. Reads `GET /business-hours/calendar/`, the org's default
 * calendar (created on first read if missing). This is the calendar every SLA
 * target is measured against.
 *
 * Reshape, not analytics. The backend stores the week as fourteen flat
 * TimeFields (`monday_open`/`monday_close` … `sunday_open`/`sunday_close`, a
 * null pair meaning "closed") and serializes each as "HH:MM:SS". The page reads
 * an ordered `days: [{ day, open, close }]` Monday-first, with times as "HH:MM",
 * so fold the flat fields into that array here and trim the seconds. Holidays
 * already arrive as `{ id, date, name }`.
 *
 * WRITE PATHS, AND WHO MAY USE THEM
 * `updateBusinessHours` runs the fold above backwards: `unfoldDays` turns the
 * page's `days` array back into the fourteen flat fields, Monday-first, null
 * for a closed day. It PUTs the calendar's OWN url, `/business-hours/calendar/
 * <id>/`, not the collection path this module's read uses; `BusinessCalendarView.put`
 * is `partial=True` and admin-only, and `is_default` is read-only on
 * `BusinessCalendarSerializer`, so it is never part of the outgoing body.
 * `addHoliday` and `removeHoliday` write the holiday sub-resource,
 * `/business-hours/calendar/<id>/holidays/` and its `<hid>/` detail, also
 * admin-only. A holiday add is idempotent on date: posting a date already on
 * the calendar returns the existing row with 200, not 201, and creates
 * nothing new; that is a normal outcome, not a failure to surface. A holiday
 * removal is a hard delete, the row is gone and the day counts as working
 * time again immediately. All three fail with 403 and
 * `{"error": "Only admins can update business hours."}` for a non-admin;
 * `can_edit` below only decides whether the edit controls are offered, since
 * the backend re-derives admin status from the request's own profile and is
 * what actually refuses.
