/**
 * Tasks: the seventh v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Same rules as the six before it: this file lives under `$lib/server` because
 * SvelteKit refuses to bundle that directory into client code and the access
 * token is an httpOnly cookie. The org is never a parameter; it is a claim
 * inside the JWT and the backend reads it from there.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE, AND WHY NOW
 * The contact page already renders a **Tasks** rail from real rows. It has
 * since contacts were wired, and every one of those rows was a dead end,
 * because there was no task page to link to. That is a quieter failure than
 * the ticket rail that pointed at a 404 last session: nothing was broken,
 * there was simply nowhere to go. It also turned out to be the module whose
 * three red tests nobody had read.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE FIXTURES CAME OFF
 * - **A task cannot be attached to an invoice.** The mock had one, `related:
 *   { kind: 'invoice', … }` linking to `/invoices/INV-2025-0142`. `Task`
 *   has four optional parents: account, opportunity, case, lead. There is no
 *   invoice FK and no endpoint that would populate one, so that kind is gone.
 * - **"Done this week" is not computable.** It was the fourth stat card.
 *   `Task` has no `completed_at` column, only `BoardTask` does, so nothing
 *   records *when* a task was finished, and a card counting it would have been
 *   inventing the number. In its place: **no due date**, which is real, and is
 *   the count that matters most, because a task with no due date is never
 *   overdue and never due this week and so never appears in front of anyone.
 * - `assigned_to` is a list of resolved display names in the mock. It is M2M
 *   on the model and stays a list here; `toRow` keeps ids alongside names, so
 *   an edit can preserve co-assignees instead of dropping them.
 * - `related` is derived here, once, from the four nullable columns, the way
 *   the mock promised the API layer would. Nothing in the UI branches on which
 *   column was populated.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIXTURE GOT RIGHT
 * That the row itself is the work. Every other list in this app is a set of
 * links to somewhere you do the thing; a task list is where you do it. The
 * per-row tick is a real PATCH now, and the mock's own note asked for exactly
 * that: "what it must never become is a tick that looks saved and is not."
