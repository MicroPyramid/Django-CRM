/**
 * Pipeline: the second v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Same rules as `leads.js`, which has the long version of the reasoning:
 * this file lives under `$lib/server` because SvelteKit refuses to bundle
 * that directory into client code and the access token is an httpOnly
 * cookie; the org is never a parameter, only ever a claim inside the JWT.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE FIXTURES CAME OFF
 * Three things the mock showed do not exist on `Opportunity` and are gone
 * rather than faked: `next_action` (there is no such field, and nothing
 * derives one), `last_activity_at` (aging is measured from `stage_changed_at`,
 * which is a different claim), and a contact's `relationship` (Contact has
 * `title` and `department`). The related invoices and tickets rail is also
 * gone. Those are real models, but attaching them to a deal means querying
 * two more modules per page load for a panel nobody asked for; add it back
 * deliberately if it earns the round trips.
 *
 * NUMBERS ARRIVE AS STRINGS
 * DRF renders `DecimalField` as a string, so `amount`, `unit_price` and the
 * line-item totals come back as `"42000.00"`. The pages sum them. `"1" + "2"`
 * is `"12"`, so every one of them is coerced here, at the boundary, rather
 * than in whichever component happens to add them up first.
