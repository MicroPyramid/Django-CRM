 * (admin-only, auto-created on first read). The endpoint returns the four
 * policy fields (is_enabled, reopen_window_days, reopen_to_status,
 * notify_assigned) alongside three 30-day metrics the settings page draws,
 * reopened_last_30d, replies_after_window_30d, median_days_to_reply, all
 * computed server-side from the reopen audit trail (REOPENED activities + the
 * out-of-window flag the signal writes on late replies).
 *
 * `updateReopenPolicy` below is the write path: `PUT /cases/reopen-policy/`,
 * admin-only, `partial=True` on the backend but sent as all four fields at
 * once. The page's own `+page.server.js` action turns a rejected save into a
 * message the user reads.
