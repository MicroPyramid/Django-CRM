/**
 * Knowledge base: the sixth v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Same rules as the five before it: this file lives under `$lib/server`
 * because SvelteKit refuses to bundle that directory into client code and the
 * access token is an httpOnly cookie. The org is never a parameter; it is a
 * claim inside the JWT and the backend reads it from there.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE, AND WHY NOW
 * The ticket page shipped last with a rail of **linked articles**, each one an
 * `<a href="/solutions/<uuid>">` built from a real `Case.solutions` row.
 * Pointing at a page whose fixtures were keyed `'SOL-01'`. Every one of those
 * links was a 404 waiting for the first org that filed an article against a
 * ticket. The link crawl did not catch it because no seeded case has a linked
 * solution and no seeded org has an article at all: the knowledge base has
 * never been seeded, which is a good part of why nobody had looked at it.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE FIXTURES CAME OFF
 * - `use_count` is `case_count`. The number of tickets the article is filed
 *   against. Same idea, and it is real; the mock just named it something the
 *   API does not have.
 * - `author` is new on the wire. `created_by` serialized as a bare `User`
 *   UUID, so the Author column in the mock was showing a name the endpoint
 *   could not have supplied.
 * - **"Related articles" is gone.** The mock's detail page listed three other
 *   articles under that heading with no explanation of the relation, and
 *   there is no endpoint that computes one, no tags, no embeddings, no
 *   "customers also read". In its place the page lists the **tickets this
 *   article is filed against**, which is a relation the database actually
 *   holds, and which closes the loop: the ticket already links to the article.
 * - The mock's new-article form said an article could be published while still
 *   a draft; "that is allowed, and sometimes right". It is not: the model's
 *   `publish()` refuses it and the serializer now refuses it on every path.
 *   The form says the rule instead of contradicting it.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIXTURE GOT RIGHT
 * That `status` and `is_published` are two different facts and collapsing them
 * into one switch loses the state worth surfacing. Approved but nobody has
 * released it. That row is the one stat card on the list page.
