/**
 * Leads: the first v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN `$lib/server`
 * SvelteKit refuses to bundle anything under `src/lib/server` into client
 * code, and that guarantee is the point: the access token is read from an
 * httpOnly cookie in here. A module importable from a `+page.js`, and
 * therefore from the browser, cannot be where authenticated requests are
 * made. Leads was the first module to move here off the old mock facade; every
 * other module has since followed and the facade (`$lib/v2/api.js` and
 * `$lib/v2/mock/`) is gone.
 *
 * SHAPES
 * The functions below return the shapes the v2 pages already consume, so the
 * pages did not have to change to stop being mocks. Where the mock invented a
 * field the backend does not have, the field is gone rather than faked;
 * `last_activity_at` is the notable one; see `listLeads`.
 *
 * SECURITY
 * The org is never a parameter here. It is a claim inside the JWT, read
 * server-side by `RLSContextMiddleware`, and `LeadListView` filters on
 * `request.profile.org` besides. Adding an `org` argument to any of these
 * would be inventing a way for a caller to ask for another tenant's rows.
