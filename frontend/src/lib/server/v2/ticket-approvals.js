/**
 * Approval rules: the wiring behind `/settings/ticket-approvals`.
 *
 * Server-only. Reads `GET /cases/approval-rules/`, the rules that gate a ticket
 * close and who can clear them. Each rule carries its match conditions, the
 * approver role / named approvers, and a backend-computed `pending_count` (the
 * Approval rows in state "pending" bound to it). Totals carry `count`, `active`,
 * and `pending` (the org's total waiting approvals).
 *
 * Create, edit, turn off, turn on and delete are wired below. Delete is not
 * what its name says on this resource: it destroys a rule that has never been
 * used and turns off one that has, and it answers 2xx either way. See
 * `deleteApprovalRule` for how the two are told apart.
 *
 * The backend
 * returns `approvers` as `[{ id, email }]`; that shape is kept as-is rather than
 * flattened to bare email strings, because the edit form needs the ids to
 * preselect the approver multi-select. The page reads `.email` off each entry
 * for the sentence it renders on the row.

/**
 * Delete a rule, or turn it off, depending on what the backend decides.
 *
 * There IS a soft-delete hiding behind this verb, and an earlier version of
 * this comment said the opposite. `ApprovalRuleDetailView.delete` branches:
 *
 * ```python
 * if rule.requests.exists():
 *     rule.is_active = False
 *     rule.save(update_fields=["is_active", "updated_at"])
 *     return Response({"id": str(rule.id), "is_active": False}, status=200)
 * rule.delete()
 * ```
 *
 * `Approval.rule` is `on_delete=models.PROTECT`, so a rule that has ever gated
 * a close cannot be destroyed without taking the approval history with it. The
 * view turns it off instead and still answers 2xx, so the caller cannot read
 * the outcome off "did it throw".
 *
 * Two things make the outcome unguessable from the page's own data:
 *
 * - `rule.requests.exists()` counts approvals in EVERY state. The
 *   `pending_count` the page already has counts only `state="pending"`, so a
 *   rule showing zero pending can still have history and still be soft
 *   disabled.
 * - The two branches differ only in their body. `apiRequest` returns the
 *   parsed body on 200 and `null` on the hard-delete branch's 204, so
 *   `is_active === false` in the response is the signal, and the absence of a
 *   body is the other one.
 *
 * Hence the return shape: the action that calls this reports what happened
 * rather than asserting what it hoped for.
 *
 * @param {{ cookies: import('@sveltejs/kit').Cookies }} event
 * @returns {Promise<{ turned_off: boolean }>} `turned_off` is true when the
 *   rule had history and was disabled rather than destroyed.
