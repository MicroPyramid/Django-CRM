/**
 * Reading filters off a URL, and turning them into an API query.
 *
 * Server-only: it is imported by `+page.server.js`, never by a component.
 *
 * Two allow-lists, deliberately, not one. `readFilters` drops anything the page
 * descriptor does not declare, so a hand-typed param never becomes a variable
 * this layer carries. `buildFilterQuery` then decides what reaches the API, the
 * same shape `CREATE_FIELDS` / `buildBody` use in every other v2 module.
 *
 * Neither is the security boundary. The backend gates `include_deleted` on
 * `is_org_admin` itself (`cases/views.py:176`). These exist so the UI does not
 * silently inherit every param these endpoints grow.

 * nonsense".
 *
 * Opaque ids (person, tag, account) are checked for UUID SHAPE only, not for
 * existence, which would cost a fetch. Shape is enough to matter: every list
 * endpoint answers 500 on a malformed id, because the value reaches Django as
 * `id__in=['x']` and psycopg raises before any handler sees it. Verified
 * against `/opportunities/`, `/opportunities/kanban/`, `/leads/`, `/cases/`,
 * `/accounts/` and `/tasks/`, all six of which return 500 for `?tags=x`. This
 * is not a security control, the backend remains the trust boundary; it stops
 * a stale bookmark or an edited URL from taking a page down.
 *
 * Preset-only params such as `all`, `inactive` and `visibility` are NOT handled
 * here. Each page's `load` already interprets its own, and this function
 * deliberately does not duplicate that logic.
