/**
 * Inbound mailboxes: the wiring behind `/settings/inbound-email`.
 *
 * Server-only. Reads `GET /cases/mailboxes/`, the addresses that turn email
 * into tickets. Each row carries its defaults (priority, case type, assignee)
 * plus two backend-computed metrics, `cases_last_30d` (tickets opened from the
 * address in 30 days) and `last_received_at` (newest mail seen), both attributed
 * exactly via the `EmailMessage.mailbox` FK. Totals carry `count`, `active`, and
 * the org's `cases_last_30d`.
 *
 * NO SECRETS. `webhook_secret` is the credential that proves a delivery really
 * came from the provider. Anything holding it can forge tickets into this org.
 * The backend already strips it for non-admins, but this layer drops it for
 * everyone: it is never needed to render the page, so it never reaches the
 * browser, admin or not. `topic_arn` embeds the AWS account id and is held to
 * the same bar. Rotation and a one-time reveal on create are an explicit,
 * separate feature this task does not build, not a field on a page you can
 * browse to.
 *
 * The rule extends to the write side, below: `CREATE_FIELDS` and
 * `UPDATE_FIELDS` exclude both fields too, on purpose, not by oversight. See
 * the comment above `CREATE_FIELDS` for why omitting them is strictly better
 * than any form could do.
 *
 * Create, edit, turn off, turn on and delete are wired below. The backend
 * returns `default_assignee` as a full profile object (name under
 * `user_details.name`); the page wants `{ id, name }`.

 *  provider-issued key can be stored ahead of an integration, and a form field
 *  for it would mean a credential travels to a browser and back on every edit
 *  while an empty one blanks the column, so this page has neither.
