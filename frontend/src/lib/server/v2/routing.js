/**
 * Ticket routing rules: the wiring behind `/settings/routing`.
 *
 * Server-only. Reads `GET /cases/routing-rules/`, ordered by priority (the
 * order IS the behaviour: the engine runs rules top-down and takes the first
 * match). Each rule carries its conditions, strategy, targets, and two things
 * the backend computes from the ROUTED activity log, `matched_last_30d` (how
 * often the rule fired) and the round-robin `state.last_assigned_index` (so the
 * page can name who is next). The response also carries org totals, including
 * `unrouted_last_30d` (cases no rule matched).
 *
 * Create, edit, turn off, turn on and delete are wired below. Drag-to-reorder
 * is still a deferred builder, so `priority_order` is a plain number field on
 * the form rather than something a drag sets. The backend returns
 * `target_assignees` as full profile objects (name under `user_details.name`,
 * plus `is_active`, which the page flags on) and `target_team` as a full team
 * object; the page wants `{ id, name, is_active }` / `{ id, name }`, so
 * flatten here.
