/**
 * Macros: the wiring behind `/settings/macros`.
 *
 * Server-only. Reads one endpoint, `GET /macros/`, which returns the macros
 * visible to the requester (every org-scope row plus their own personal ones),
 * a `totals` block for the stat cards, and the server's `placeholders` set for
 * the reference card. Visibility is decided by the API from the JWT, a member
 * never sees another member's personal macros, so nothing here filters rows.
 *
 * WRITE PATHS, AND WHO MAY USE THEM
 * This page's permission model is unlike the rest of settings. Every
 * signed-in member may create, edit and delete their own `personal` macros;
 * only an admin may do any of that to an `org`-scope macro.
 * `_resolve_scope_and_owner` enforces the scope rule server-side and turns a
 * non-admin's org-scope attempt into 403, so `owner` is never sent from
 * here: it is derived from `request.profile` on the way in, and a client
 * that could name one could file a macro as somebody else. Editing someone
 * else's personal macro answers 404, not 403, on purpose
 * (`MacroDetailView._get_writable`), so the id space cannot be used to
 * discover which rows are other people's private macros; callers of
 * `updateMacro`/`deleteMacro` have to carry that distinction through to
 * their error copy rather than "fixing" it into a uniform 403.
 *
 * Delete is soft for an org macro (`is_active` flips to false, the row stays
 * and stays counted) and a hard delete for a personal one. Both go through
 * `deleteMacro`, one endpoint; which happens is decided by the row's own
 * scope server-side, never by anything this module sends.
 *
 * The one reshape is `owner`: the API returns it as a Profile id plus a
 * separate `owner_name` (the owner's email; `User` has no display name), while
 * the page wants a nested `{ id, name }` it can print. Org macros have no owner
 * (they are shared) and stay `null`. `unknown_placeholders` is computed by the
 * server per row and passed straight through. The page never recomputes which
 * tokens are broken, so its "broken placeholder" flag can't drift from the set
 * the renderer actually expands.
