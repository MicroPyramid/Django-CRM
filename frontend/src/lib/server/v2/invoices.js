/**
 * Invoices: the eighth v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Same rules as the seven before it: this file lives under `$lib/server`
 * because SvelteKit refuses to bundle that directory into client code and the
 * access token is an httpOnly cookie. The org is never a parameter; it is a
 * claim inside the JWT and the backend reads it from there.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE, AND WHY NOW
 * The account page has rendered a real Invoices rail since accounts were wired
 *: actual rows, with a "View all" that pointed at the fixture list, and rows
 * that were deliberately *not* links because there was no invoice page to open.
 * Same quiet dead end the Tasks rail was last session. Wiring the list and the
 * detail turns both into real links.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE FIXTURES CAME OFF
 * - **The reminders log is not a thing.** The mock detail carried a per-reminder
 *   history, "First reminder · opened · 8d ago", with read receipts. The
 *   model records no such log and tracks no opens: it has `reminder_count`,
 *   `last_reminder_sent` and the on/off settings, nothing per-send and nothing
 *   about the client opening anything. The rail now shows those real settings;
 *   the invented "they opened it" line is gone.
 * - **Line items carry discount and tax the mock summary ignored.** The mock
 *   detail recomputed subtotal as `Σ qty×rate` and called the remainder "tax",
 *   which silently folds any discount into the tax line. Real invoices have
 *   `subtotal`, `discount_amount` and `tax_amount` computed server-side, so the
 *   page shows those figures instead of re-deriving them wrong.
 * - **Status "Overdue" is a real status, not a UI flourish.** A daily task
 *   (`mark_overdue_invoices`) flips unpaid past-due invoices to it, so the
 *   detail page's Overdue branch stays. It is describing a column, not
 *   guessing from the due date.
 *
 * WHAT STAYED FIXTURES, ON PURPOSE
 * Only the core invoice entity is wired here: list, detail, and the lifecycle
 * writes on the detail page. Estimates, recurring, products, templates and the
 * reports dashboard are separate entities on separate endpoints; they keep
 * their fixtures and their preview banner (see `migrated.js`). Bringing the
 * invoice list to the real API did not bring them, exactly as wiring the task
 * list did not wire the board.
