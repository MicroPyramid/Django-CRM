/**
 * Documents: the thirteenth v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Lives under `$lib/server` like the twelve before it: SvelteKit keeps this
 * directory out of the client bundle, so the httpOnly access token never
 * reaches the browser. Org is a JWT claim the backend re-derives; it is never a
 * parameter here.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE
 * `/documents` is a top-of-sidebar destination that still read a fixture:
 * its list rendered mock rows and its "Upload" button wrote nowhere. `Document`
 * has had a full API (`common/views/document_views.py`) since the first
 * migration and neither v1 nor Flutter ever drew it, so its access rules had
 * only ever been exercised by tests. Wiring it drove those rules for real.
 * The org-scoped, share-aware list read, plus the three writes (upload, edit,
 * delete).
 *
 * THE FINDING THE WIRING EXPOSED
 * `DocumentDetailView.put`/`patch` authorised on `_may_read`: creator, anyone
 * in `shared_to`, any member of a shared `teams`, or an admin. So anyone a
 * document was merely *shared with* could overwrite its file, rename it, flip
 * its status to `inactive` (hiding it), and, through PUT, which clears the M2M
 * before re-adding, wipe the whole share list and lock everyone else out. The
 * same view already gated `delete` narrowly with a written rationale ("a share
 * hands someone a copy to work with, not the right to remove it from everyone
 * else"); rewriting the bytes behind a title is at least as destructive as
 * deleting the row, yet mutation was left at read level. The backend fix adds
 * `_may_write` = `_may_delete` (creator or admin) and uses it on PUT and PATCH.
 * This file only offers an Edit affordance where the viewer can write, but that
 * is a UX hint. The serializer/view is the trust boundary. Uploading is a
 * separate, unrestricted operation: any org member may add a document (the
 * server checks only auth + org), so the page does not gate the Upload button.
 *
 * WHAT THE MOCK ASSUMED THAT THE API SHAPES DIFFERENTLY
 * - `GET /api/documents/` returns two separately paginated envelopes
 *   (`documents_active` / `documents_inactive`) plus a `users` list, a v1
 *   artefact. `listDocuments` flattens both into the one list the page reads
 *   and recomputes the totals here (there is no summary endpoint), never a
 *   second query.
 * - `shared_to` is a nested `ProfileSerializer`; `toDoc` collapses each to
 *   `{ id, name }`. `created_by` is a `UserSerializer` (its `id` is the *user*
 *   id, which is what `can_write` compares the JWT `user_id` against).
 * - `file_kind` is derived from the filename here; `size_bytes` and each team's
 *   `member_count` are now returned by `DocumentSerializer` because they cannot
 *   be derived from the filename alone.
 * - `document_file` is a stored path and is only ever displayed. Constructing a
 *   media URL in the client is how a private file becomes a public one; the
 *   server decides who gets the bytes. `download_href` is that decision made
 *   properly: a route on this origin that streams from an authenticated
 *   endpoint gated by the same `_may_read` the detail view uses.
