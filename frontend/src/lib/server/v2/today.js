/**
 * The Today queue: the wiring behind the v2 home (`/`).
 *
 * Server-only. Reads one endpoint, `GET /dashboard/today/`, which rolls four
 * sources into a single prioritised action list: support cases still awaiting a
 * first reply, invoices past due, deals that have gone quiet (stage-aging), and
 * tasks overdue or due today. The endpoint is org-scoped from the JWT and, for a
 * member, restricted to rows assigned to or created by them, so nothing here
 * decides visibility; the API does.
 *
 * This is read-only: the home page links out to each item's own module, where
 * the writes already live. There is no write path to wire here.
 *
 * The response shape IS the page's shape (`{ queue, summary, later }`), so
 * there is nothing to reshape; the fixture that preceded it was built to match
 * this contract. `queue[].href` is always an internal `/...` path the server
 * built (never a stored value), so there is no untrusted-link concern here.
