/**
 * Contacts: the fourth v2 module wired to the real API.
 *
 * Same rules as `leads.js`, `deals.js` and `accounts.js`: this file lives under
 * `$lib/server` because SvelteKit refuses to bundle that directory into client
 * code and the access token is an httpOnly cookie. The org is never a
 * parameter; it is a claim inside the JWT and the backend reads it from there.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE, AND WHY NOW
 * Three wired pages already show people: a lead's converted contact, the
 * deal's contact rail, the account's people rail, and not one of them could
 * link to a person, because `/contacts/<uuid>` answered 404. The rails were
 * written as dead text for exactly that reason. Contacts was also the last
 * object in the core record graph still on fixtures: leads become an account,
 * a contact and a deal, and three quarters of that sentence was live.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN THE FIXTURES CAME OFF
 * - `relationship` ("Champion", "Blocker") is gone for the fourth time. Contact
 *   has `title` and `department`. It was a table column, a rail row, a subtitle
 *   under every colleague and part of the headline sentence.
 * - `last_activity_at` is gone. Nothing records when anyone last spoke to a
 *   contact: Lead has `last_contacted`, Contact has nothing like it, and there
 *   is no activity table to derive one from. The list sorted by it, coloured a
 *   column by it, and the detail page built its whole "gone quiet" argument on
 *   it. What is real is `updated_at`, when the record was last edited, and
 *   that is what the pages show, under a label that says so.
 * - `account_id` was a single account. A contact is joined to an account twice
 *   over (`Contact.account`, the model's "primary", and membership of
 *   `Account.contacts`) and the second is many-to-many: people here belong to
 *   nought, one, two or three accounts. Both links are published now, and this
 *   layer picks the primary if there is one and the first membership otherwise.
 * - `organization` survives but is demoted. It is free text and, across the
 *   seeded org, routinely names a different company from the account the person
 *   is actually attached to, so it is shown only where there is no account
 *   link to show instead, labelled as what somebody typed.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIXTURE GOT RIGHT
 * Splitting "do not call" from "inactive": one is a rule about how you may
 * contact this person, the other is whether they still work there. Both are
 * real fields and both are still marked separately.
