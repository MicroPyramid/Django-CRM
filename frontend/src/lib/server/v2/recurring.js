/**
 * Recurring invoices: the sixteenth v2 module, third of the invoices sub-pages.
 *
 * Same rules as the fifteen before it: server-only, because the access token is
 * an httpOnly cookie; the org is a JWT claim the backend reads, never a param.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE, AND THE FINDING IT CARRIED
 * A recurring invoice is an owned billing record, `AssignableMixin` +
 * `created_by`, the same shape as Invoice and Estimate, but its endpoints
 * filtered on `org` ONLY: no object-level check on detail/update/delete/toggle
 * and no non-admin list scoping. Any member could read, edit, delete or
 * pause/resume every schedule in the org, while Invoice and Estimate beside it
 * scoped non-admins to their own and assigned. That was fixed on the backend
 * (a `get_recurring_or_error` mirroring the estimate one, plus list scoping);
 * this page is the client that finally draws the writes those endpoints guard.
 *
 * THE ONE WRITE, THEN THE SECOND
 * The page's thesis is "does anyone have to do anything"; `auto_send`, and
 * whether a schedule is live or paused. Pause/resume was the first write, next
 * to the state it changes (`toggle`). Creating a schedule is the second: a
 * builder with line items and three FK pickers, the same shape as the invoice
 * builder (#48), and it lives here as `createRecurringInvoice`.
 *
 * TOTALS ARE COMPUTED HERE
 * The list endpoint has no `totals` envelope. The four header figures are
 * derived from the rows the API returns for this requester (org-wide for an
 * admin, own-and-assigned for a member), so the pills and the table describe the
 * same set. `monthly_run_rate` normalises every ACTIVE schedule to a month by
 * its cadence. The one figure nobody can eyeball off the rows, because each is
 * on a different frequency. `limit=1000`; past that the derived figures would
 * undercount, and that ceiling is called out where it is set.

 * security improvement, and the backend is the boundary either way.
 *
 * The four guards below are fast fails for obvious mistakes. Three mirror real
 * server rules: `account_id` and `contact_id` are required by
 * `RecurringInvoiceCreateSerializer` (and it also cross-checks that the
 * contact belongs to the account), and `title` is required because
 * `RecurringInvoice.title` is a `CharField(max_length=100)` with no
 * `blank=True`, so DRF makes it required and non-blank there too. The
 * `custom_days` guard does not mirror anything: the serializer has no
 * cross-validation between `frequency` and `custom_days`, so a CUSTOM schedule
 * with no interval is accepted server-side and then silently generates monthly
 * via `calculate_next_date()`. That is a backend gap; this check keeps the form
 * from walking into it.
 *
 * `RecurringInvoiceListView.post` (`backend/invoices/api_views.py`) wraps its
 * result in an envelope, `{ error, message, recurring_invoice }`, exactly the
 * trap `createTag` documents in `tags.js`: a `create*` function that resolves
 * to the envelope instead of the record is the one the next caller reaches
 * for `.id` on and gets `undefined`. This unwraps to `.recurring_invoice`
 * deliberately, with the same `?? resp` fallback as `createTag`, so a change
 * in the backend's response shape degrades to the raw envelope rather than
 * throwing.
