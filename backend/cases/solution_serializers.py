        only half did:

        * `validate_is_published` was guarded by `if value and self.instance`,
          so on **create**, where `self.instance` is None, it did not run at
          all. `POST {"status": "draft", "is_published": true}` returned 201
          with a published draft: the review workflow skipped in one request.
          Proven against the running server.
        * On update it read the **stored** status, never the incoming one, and
          it only ran when `is_published` was in the body. So the demotion was
          free, `PATCH {"status": "draft"}` on an approved, published article
          left `is_published` true. Proven the same way. That is the CLAUDE.md
          rule about validating the *source* state of a transition rather than
          only its target, in miniature.

        Resolving both fields against `self.instance` first is what makes a
