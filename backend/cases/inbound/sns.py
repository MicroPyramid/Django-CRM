"""SNS message verification.

AWS SNS posts JSON like:

  {
    "Type": "Notification",            // or "SubscriptionConfirmation"
    "MessageId": "...",
    "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:...:...:...",
    "Subject": "Amazon SES Email Receipt",
    "Message": "<raw-email-or-json>",
    "Timestamp": "2026-05-09T12:00:00.000Z",
    "SignatureVersion": "1",           // or "2" for SHA-256
    "Signature": "<base64>",
    "SigningCertURL": "https://sns.<region>.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-XXXX.pem",
    "SubscribeURL": "https://sns...",  // SubscriptionConfirmation only
    "Token": "..."                     // SubscriptionConfirmation only
  }

We verify the signature against the AWS-published certificate so that an
attacker can't post arbitrary JSON to our public webhook URL. The cert URL
is pinned to the `sns.<region>.amazonaws.com` host family.

Three controls keep that pinning honest (CodeQL `py/full-ssrf` #27/#28):

* **No redirects.** The host allow-list is applied to the URL we are about to
  fetch; following a 3xx would land us somewhere never checked. `_OPENER`
  surfaces the redirect as an error instead of chasing it.
* **Strict TLS.** The fetch uses an explicit default-verifying SSL context, so
  transport trust is anchored to the CA store and can't silently degrade. This,
  not the signing cert's own issuer chain, is what proves the PEM really
  came from AWS.
* **Certificate validation.** The fetched cert must be inside its validity
  window and carry a subject CN in the same SNS host family, so a stale or
  foreign cert can't be used to satisfy the signature check.

Note on chain validation: we deliberately do *not* run X.509 path validation on
the signing certificate. AWS serves a bare leaf from these URLs with no bundled
intermediates, so `build_server_verifier`/`build_client_verifier` would fail on
genuine traffic (and the leaf's EKU/SAN shape is not contractual). Transport
trust plus the CN and validity checks are the durable controls here.
