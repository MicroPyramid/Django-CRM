"""Who may do what to a knowledge-base article, three rules, beside the
three in `cases.access` and for the same reason.

Before this module the Solution endpoints had **no authorization at all**.
`IsAuthenticated` was the whole of it, so any member of the org could rewrite,
approve, publish, unpublish and hard-delete any article, including one an admin
had written and released. Proven against the running server as a plain `USER`
profile: `PATCH` a colleague's article 200, `POST .../publish/` 200,
`DELETE` 204.

    write     author · admin      title, body, and moving draft ↔ reviewed
    release   admin               status → approved, and publish / unpublish
    delete    author · admin

**Why `release` is narrower than `write`.** The model already carries a review
workflow (draft → reviewed → approved, plus a separate `is_published`), and
the whole point of it is that somebody other than the writer says the answer is
right before customers are shown it. If the author can approve their own
article the workflow is theatre; the rules, the states and the UI would all
still be there and none of them would mean anything. That is the same failure
already recorded against the case close-approval gate, so it is not a
hypothetical shape of bug for this codebase.

`read` is deliberately absent: every member of the org may read every article.
A knowledge base whose articles are hidden from the agents answering the
tickets is not a knowledge base. `is_published` is not an access rule either.
It is the customer-visibility switch, and the customer-facing site it gates was
explicitly cut (see `kb_views`), so today it gates the agent suggester only.
