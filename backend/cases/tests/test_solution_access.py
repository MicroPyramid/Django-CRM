"""Rules the knowledge base documented but did not enforce.

Every case below was driven against the running API before the fix and
answered the wrong thing. What was broken:

1.  The Solution endpoints had **no authorization at all**; `IsAuthenticated`
    was the whole of it. A plain `USER` could rewrite an admin's article
    (200), publish it to customers (200) and hard-delete it (204). The
    draft → reviewed → approved workflow, the publish and unpublish
    endpoints and the settings UI around them were all decoration: whoever
    wrote an article could approve their own work and release it.
2.  `validate_is_published` was guarded by `if value and self.instance`, so on
    **create** it did not run. `POST {"status": "draft", "is_published":
    true}` returned 201 with a published draft.
3.  On update the same check read the **stored** status, never the incoming
    one, and only ran when `is_published` was in the body, so
    `PATCH {"status": "draft"}` on an approved, published article left it
    published. The invariant the model asserts ("published implies approved")
    held on one path in three.
4.  `SolutionDetailSerializer.get_linked_cases` returned the **full 33-field
    case payload** for every linked case with no access check, and
    `CaseSolutionLinkView` checked org and nothing else. So a member refused
    a case with a 403 could link an article to that very case and read its
    name, description, account and contacts back out of the article.
5.  A malformed id was a **500** on every verb. Read, update, delete,
    publish, unpublish, because a UUID column raises `ValidationError`
    rather than returning nothing, and the views caught only
    `Solution.DoesNotExist`.
6.  `?is_published=1` silently meant *unpublished*: the parse was
    `value.lower() == "true"`, so every other spelling of true inverted the
    filter.
7.  The list served `case_count` and a nested `org` per row without fetching
    either, 13 articles cost 27 queries, and `created_by` came back as a
    bare `User` UUID, so no client could name the author.
