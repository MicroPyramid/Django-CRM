"""Approvals disclose the case behind them, so they need the case's read rule.

``ApprovalSerializer.case_summary`` carries a case's name, status, priority and
account name. ``ApprovalInboxView`` listed every approval in the org with no
visibility filter at all, so any member could read that summary for cases
``cases.access`` would refuse to open, and ``?state=all`` returned the lot.
``CaseRequestApprovalView`` had the same gap on a single case: org membership
was the only check, so a member could file a request against a case they cannot
see and read the summary back out of the 201.

The rule cannot simply be ``visible_cases_qs``. An approver is routinely
somebody with no stake in the case, and handing them the decision is the whole
point of the queue. So a row is visible when the caller is an admin, or may
read the case, or is in the rule's approver pool, or filed the request.

Every one of those four is asserted here, along with the member who satisfies
none of them. A filter that hides rows from their own approver is an outage,
and one that shows them to everybody is the bug.
