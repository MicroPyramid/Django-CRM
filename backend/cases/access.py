"""Who may do what to a case, one place, three rules.

Before this module the question was answered in five places and had drifted
into three different answers:

* `CaseListView` and `watcher_views._visible_cases_qs` said **admin, creator,
  assignee or watcher**.
* `CaseDetailView.get` / `.put` / `.patch` / `.post` and
  `CaseActivityListView` said **admin, creator or assignee**, no watcher.
* `CaseDetailView.delete` said **admin or creator**, no assignee either.

The visible consequence was a queue that lied. A watcher's ticket list showed
the one case they follow; opening it answered 403. That is the same shape of
contradiction accounts and contacts had, and the same conclusion applies:
when the verbs disagree by accident it is a mistake, not a policy.

Where they disagree *on purpose*, they now say so. Reading, writing and
deleting are three rules on three lines, deliberately not one:

    read    admin · creator · assignee · watcher
    write   admin · creator · assignee
    delete  admin · creator

Watching is subscribing to a ticket, not being handed the keys to it, so the
watcher clause that was missing from reads is not quietly added to writes.
