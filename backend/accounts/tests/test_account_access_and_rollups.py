"""Object-level access on an account, and the numbers the account page prints.

Written while wiring `/v2/accounts` to the real API. Every case here failed
against the code as it stood, or pins a behaviour that was one edit away from
breaking:

1. `get`, `put`, `patch` and comment `post` compared `request.profile`, a
   Profile: against `account.created_by`, a FK to `User`. Never equal, so the
   creator branch was unreachable. `delete()` and the list filter compared
   correctly, which is how you can tell: the same non-admin could see an
   account in their own list, be refused permission to open it, and delete it
   anyway.
2. `users_mention` read `created_by.user.email`. `created_by` *is* the User, so
   that was an AttributeError, a 500 for every non-admin assignee who opened
   an account they were legitimately assigned.
3. Commenting on an id that does not exist raised `DoesNotExist` (500) where
   `get` on the same id answered 404.
4. `AccountAttachmentView.delete` looked its row up by primary key with no org
   filter. `Attachments` is one generic table shared by every module, so that
   endpoint deleted any attachment in the database, any org, any parent record.
5. A negative `annual_revenue` reached the CheckConstraint and came back as an
   IntegrityError, i.e. a 500 naming no field.
6. The account page's money had no source at all. `won_amount`, `open_pipeline`,
   `overdue_amount` and the counts beside them are now annotated in SQL, and
   the interesting case is an account with several deals *and* several invoices,
   a single `.annotate(Sum(...), Sum(...))` multiplies those together.
