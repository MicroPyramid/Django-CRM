"""
Centralised object-level authorization for invoice- and estimate-scoped
endpoints.

Every such endpoint must answer the same two questions in the same order:

1. Does this record exist *in the caller's org*?  -> 404 if not, so that a
   caller in another org cannot probe for record IDs.
2. May this caller act on it?                     -> 403 if not.

Before this module each view hand-rolled that logic, and several
(``send``, ``mark-paid``, ``duplicate``, line items, payments, comments,
attachments) skipped step 2 entirely -- see GitHub issue #698. The estimate
views were worse: they never had step 2 at all, so any member could read,
edit, delete, convert or send *any* estimate in the org, and their list view
crashed outright for non-admins (see :func:`has_object_access`). Route every
invoice or estimate endpoint through :func:`get_invoice_or_error` /
:func:`get_estimate_or_error` rather than re-deriving the rule.
