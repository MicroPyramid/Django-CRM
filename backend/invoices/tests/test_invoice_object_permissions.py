"""
Object-level authorization tests for invoice-scoped API endpoints.

Regression coverage for GitHub issue #698: several invoice endpoints checked
only authentication + org membership, letting any same-org user mutate, read,
duplicate or send invoices they neither created nor were assigned to.

The attacker in every test below is ``user_client`` -- an authenticated,
non-admin, non-superuser profile in the *same* org as the target invoice, who
is not the creator and not in ``assigned_to``.
