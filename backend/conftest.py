    * It is skipped once the transaction is broken. Several tests deliberately
      provoke an ``IntegrityError`` to prove a unique constraint bites; after
      one of those, any further statement raises ``TransactionManagementError``,

    ``RLSContextMiddleware`` sets ``app.current_org`` from the JWT for the life
    of a request and clears it in a ``finally``, which is correct in production:
    the variable is session-scoped, connections are pooled, and a leftover value
    is how one tenant's context leaks into the next request. It also means that
    in a test, every ``client.get(...)`` wipes whatever the test set up, so the
    familiar "call the endpoint, then assert against the ORM" shape fails on the
    assertion rather than the behaviour under test.

    Restoring afterwards is not a hole in the enforcement: the request itself
    still ran under exactly the context the middleware derived, so any missing
    org filter still shows up. This only affects the test's own statements
    before and after.
