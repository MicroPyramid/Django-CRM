"""Authorization on `DELETE /api/opportunities/attachment/<pk>/`.

The twin of `leads/tests/test_attachment_delete_authz.py`, and the worse of the
two. This view had the unscoped `objects.get(pk=pk)` AND compared
`request.profile` (a `Profile`) to `created_by` (a FK to `User`), so the
uploader branch could never be true and a non-admin could not delete their own
upload. `test_uploader_deletes_own_attachment` is the guard for that half: it
fails against the old code with a 403 rather than a cross-org leak, which is why
it has to be here and not only in the leads twin.
