"""Downloading a file attached to a record.

`Attachments` is generic: one table hangs off leads, deals, contacts,
accounts, tickets, tasks and invoices through a ContentType. Until this view
existed there was no authenticated way to fetch the bytes, so every client
built the file's `/media/` path instead and offered that as the download.
That path is guarded by `RLSContextMiddleware` alone, which requires *an* org
context rather than *the* org, so it refuses an anonymous caller and waves
through every authenticated one, of any tenant. It also refuses the ordinary
case, because a link opened in the phone's browser or a plain `<a href>` from
the web app carries no Authorization header at all. Both clients were
therefore offering a download that could not work and, where it did work,
worked for the wrong people.

**Reading an attachment is reading the record it hangs off**, so this view
asks that record's own read predicate rather than inventing a second one.
Every one of the seven predicates below already exists and is already used by
that model's detail view. A content type not in the map is refused: a new
attachable model must opt in here deliberately, because the failure mode of
the other default is handing out somebody's file.
