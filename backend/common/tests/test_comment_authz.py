"""A comment's target and owning org are the server's to set, not the client's.

``CommentSerializer`` listed ``object_id`` and ``org`` as ordinary writable
fields. The comment edit endpoints are gated on "you wrote it, or you are an
admin" and pass ``partial=True``, so an author could send a different
``object_id`` and move their own comment onto any record in the org, including
ones the access rules would refuse them, or send a different ``org`` and push
it into another tenant.

``Comment.clean()`` compares the new org against the new target's org, so a
consistent cross-org pair satisfied it and saved. Only the Postgres RLS policy
stopped that, and RLS is the safety net here, not the contract. The tests below
run on SQLite, where there is no RLS at all, which is exactly the point: they
assert the application refuses the write on its own.

The same change repairs the edit endpoints. Four of them use this serializer
non-partial, where ``object_id`` and ``org`` were required fields no honest
client sends, so every ordinary edit failed validation before reaching a save.
