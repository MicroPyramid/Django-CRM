"""``FRONTEND_URL`` is the base of every link this system emails.

``common.links.frontend_url`` builds all of them from it: the customer's invoice
and estimate portal links, the CSAT survey, the internal "assigned to you"
notifications, and, directly in ``common/tasks.py``, the magic-link sign-in URL.
It defaults to ``http://localhost:5173`` so a checkout works with no ``.env``,
which means a deployment that never sets it mails customers a link to a port on
their own machine and mails a sign-in token to one. Nothing on the server
reports it: the email sends, the link is simply dead on arrival.

``crm/settings.py`` now refuses a loopback or non-absolute value outside dev. Dev
is left alone, because there the default is the correct answer.

These tests import the settings module in a subprocess, because the check runs at
import time and reloading it inside the test process would rewrite settings for
everything that runs afterwards. Same reason, same shape, as
``test_signing_key_strength.py``.
