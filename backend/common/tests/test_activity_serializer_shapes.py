"""Two activity feeds, two shapes, and neither may take the other's name.

`common/serializer.py` defined `ActivitySerializer` twice, 580 lines apart.
Python keeps the second, so both consumers received the dashboard shape:

* the dashboard feed wants `timestamp` and `humanized_time`, and got them
* the ticket activity timeline wants `metadata` and `created_at`, and got
  neither, so `TicketActivityTimeline.svelte` (which reads `a.metadata` in
  five places and `formatRelativeDate(a.created_at)`) rendered no metadata
  and an invalid date

Only one of the pair broke, which is why it survived: the dashboard, the
louder surface, was the one being served correctly. The second class is now
`DashboardActivitySerializer`.

These tests assert the field sets rather than a rendered page, because the
field set is what the two frontends destructure and it is what a rename or a
merge of the two classes would quietly change.
