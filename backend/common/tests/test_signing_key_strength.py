"""``SECRET_KEY`` signs every JWT, so its length is a security control.

``SIMPLE_JWT["SIGNING_KEY"]`` is ``SECRET_KEY``, and the algorithm is HS256.
RFC 7518 section 3.2 requires an HMAC key at least as long as the hash function
output, which is 32 bytes for SHA-256. PyJWT does not refuse a shorter key; it
emits a warning, once per call, into a log nobody reads. The local ``.env`` here
carried a 20-byte key for the life of the project and every token this server
issued was signed with it.

``crm/settings.py`` now raises on a short key outside dev and warns inside it.
These tests import the settings module in a subprocess, because the check runs at
import time and reloading it inside the test process would rewrite settings for
everything that runs afterwards.
