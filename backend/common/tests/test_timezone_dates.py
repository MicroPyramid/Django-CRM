"""Whose day it is, when UTC and an org's timezone disagree.

``USE_TZ`` is on, so ``timezone.now()`` is UTC and ``.date()`` on it yields the
**UTC** calendar day. That is a different day from the org's for every hour its
timezone runs ahead of UTC, and the mirror image for every zone behind. All 132
sites in this app used to compute dates that way, so a task due today dropped
out of the Today queue and an invoice was not overdue on the day it came due.

They now go through ``timezone.localdate()``, which answers in whichever
timezone is active, and ``GetProfileAndOrg`` activates the org's. That makes the
day a per-tenant fact: at one instant a Kolkata org is on the 7th while a New
York org is still on the 6th, and each one's Today queue agrees with its own
wall calendar.

These tests freeze the clock inside the gap so they hold at any wall-clock time
rather than passing for 18.5 hours a day, and each one is paired with its mirror
so that a globally-computed day fails at least one of the pair.
