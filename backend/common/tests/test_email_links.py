"""Every link in an outgoing email points at the web app and at a real record.

These emails had a button whose ``href`` was ``settings.DOMAIN_NAME``, which
names the **API** host, with no path on it at all: the assignee got a "View
Lead" button that opened the Django host's root. `backend/.env` sets
``DOMAIN_NAME=""``, so in development the attribute was the empty string and
the rendered ``href=""`` reloaded whatever page the reader was on. Two other
templates appended a frontend path (``/goals``, ``/opportunities?rotten=true``)
to that backend base, and the second of those is not even a route the frontend
serves; it is ``/pipeline``.

``common.links.frontend_url`` already existed for exactly this, built when the
invoice and estimate portal links had the same defect. The rule these tests
pin: an email link is built from ``FRONTEND_URL`` and carries the path of the
thing the mail is about.

They assert on the rendered HTML rather than the context dict, because the
context key is not the contract, the anchor is: ``leads_assigned.html`` read
``{{ url|default:lead_detail_url }}`` and its two senders each filled a
different one of those names.
