    someone adds to Account would not be in it, and the omission shows up as
    deleted tenant data rather than as a failing import.

    All three on_delete behaviours matter here, which is why nothing is filtered
    by kind:

      CASCADE   deleting the sample row destroys the tenant's row with it
                (Case.account, Opportunity.account, Order.account, and the five
                children of Case including billable TimeEntry)
      PROTECT   deleting the sample row raises ProtectedError and aborts the
                whole clear (Invoice/Estimate/RecurringInvoice on Account)
      SET_NULL  deleting the sample row silently unlinks the tenant's row
                (Contact.account, Task.account, and friends)

    M2M relations are excluded on purpose: removing a through-row neither
    deletes nor orphans the other side, so it is not a reason to retain.

    normally does not count: it is the pack's own, and it has either already been
    deleted (children are processed first) or is about to be. A sample task
    pointing at a sample account is not a reason to keep that account, and a
    sample case that is the `parent` of another sample case would otherwise make
    the pair permanently undeletable.

    `retained_pks` is the exception, and it is what makes retention hold. A
    sample ticket kept because it carries billable time is no longer going
    anywhere, so its sample account must be kept too, or deleting the account
    would cascade the ticket away and take that billable time with it, which is
    exactly the loss the retention rule exists to prevent. Because the loop runs
    children first, every retained child is already known by the time its parent

    """Delete the demo records the applier created for THIS org, and nothing else.

    Keyed on `is_sample` alone. A server-set, non-serializer-writable boolean on
    all six models, never on the "Sample data" tag. `Tags.save()` recomputes its
    slug on every save and the tag CRUD endpoints have no reserved-slug guard, so
    the tag can be renamed onto this slug, adopted from an existing tag, or
    attached to any real record through the ordinary tag picker. None of that is
    destructive here: the tag is not touched by this function at all, and
    is_sample cannot be set through any client-facing serializer.

    Two rules make this safe to hand to an admin as a single button:

    1. **Children before parents.** _sample_models is reversed, so sample tasks
       and leads go before tickets, tickets before deals and contacts, and
       accounts last. A sample ticket is therefore already gone by the time its
       sample account is considered, and only the tenant's own rows are left to
       reason about.

    2. **Never take real data with it, and never fail because of it.** A user who
       logs a real deal against a demo account, bills hours against a demo
       ticket, or raises a real invoice on a demo account must lose none of it,
       and in the invoice case a naive delete would not merely lose data, it
       would raise ProtectedError and abort the entire clear. Any sample row
       still referenced by a non-sample row is kept and reported as retained.

    Returns {"deleted": {type: n}, "retained": {type: n}}. Retained is a normal
    outcome, not an error, and the UI is expected to say so.

    `actor` is optional (mirrors apply_pack's PackApplication.applied_by) and is
    used only to attribute the audit record. It plays no part in the delete,
    which is already org-scoped.
