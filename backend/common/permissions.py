def is_org_admin(profile):
    """Whether ``profile`` administers its org. ``role`` is the only source.

    A plain function and not only the ``IsOrgAdmin`` class below, because most
    callers are views that read wide and write narrow: the same endpoint is
    open to every member on GET and admin-only on POST, so the check has to
    happen inside the method rather than in ``permission_classes``.

    That is why this rule had been written out nine times, as a private
    ``_is_admin`` in nine modules, in three different spellings. Five of them
    raised ``AttributeError`` on a ``None`` profile where two returned
    ``False``. All nine agreed for a real profile, so nothing was broken; one
    edit that missed eight copies is how that stops being true.

    **This deliberately does not consult ``is_organization_admin``.** ``ROLES``
    has exactly two members, so that column and ``role == "ADMIN"`` are two
    spellings of one binary fact, and the backend used to read them
    inconsistently: 82 checks looked only at ``role`` while 43 also accepted
    the flag, with both spellings appearing inside the same file. The flag is
    the dangerous half of that pair, because no frontend surface displays or
    sets it: an admin could ``PATCH`` a colleague to
    ``{"is_organization_admin": true, "role": "USER"}`` and grant admin over
    accounts, contacts, team management and the org record itself, invisibly
    and irrevocably from the UI. ``Profile.save`` now derives the column from
    ``role`` so the two cannot disagree, and ``ProfileSerializer`` no longer
    accepts it as an input.

    ``None`` is not an admin. A view with no org context has no profile, and
    answering ``False`` gives it a clean 403 instead of a 500.
