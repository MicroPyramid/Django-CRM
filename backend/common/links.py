"""Absolute links into the web app, for emails.

Every link that leaves this system in an email points at the SvelteKit frontend,
not at the API: ``/portal/invoice/<token>`` and ``/portal/estimate/<token>`` for
customers, ``/csat/<token>`` for a survey, ``/invoices/<id>`` for a colleague.
None of those paths exist on the Django host.

They were built four different wrong ways, each independently broken:

* ``f"{protocol}://{domain}/portal/invoice/{token}"`` where every caller passed
  ``domain=settings.DOMAIN_NAME``, which already carries a scheme. The emitted
  link was ``http://http://localhost:8000/portal/invoice/…``: two schemes, dead
  on arrival even when ``DOMAIN_NAME`` was set correctly for a real deployment.
* ``DOMAIN_NAME`` names the **backend**. Even with the double scheme removed,
  the link pointed at the API host, where ``/portal/...`` 404s.
* ``send_estimate_to_client`` is dispatched with no ``domain`` at all, so it
  fell back to the ``"localhost"`` default and emitted ``http://localhost/…``.
* ``backend/.env`` sets ``DOMAIN_NAME=""``, so the CSAT builder's
  ``f"{domain}/csat/{token}"`` produced the relative ``"/csat/<token>"``, which
  is not a link at all inside an email body.

``FRONTEND_URL`` already existed and already meant exactly this: it is what the
welcome email and the magic-link sign-in URL are built from. Routing the rest
through it makes one setting answer one question, and gives an operator a single
value to get right.
