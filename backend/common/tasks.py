    Schedule via celery-beat (recommended cadence: nightly). Walks orgs and sets

    THIS USED TO DELETE NOTHING IN PRODUCTION. The previous version ran one
    unscoped DELETE and justified it in its own docstring: "RLS does not need a
    per-org context here because the query targets `read_at`, which is intrinsic
    to the row". That is not how RLS works. A policy filters which rows the
    statement can see at all, whatever the WHERE clause names, and the isolation
    policy is `org_id::text = NULLIF(current_setting('app.current_org', true),
    '')`, which matches nothing when the context is empty. A Celery worker runs
    no middleware, so the context was always empty, and under the non-superuser
    role the deployment docs mandate, the nightly DELETE removed zero rows every
    night while logging nothing (it only logs when `deleted` is truthy).

    It passed its tests because `crm.test_settings` is SQLite, which has no RLS
    at all. `set_rls_context` returns early on any non-Postgres vendor, so the
    per-org loop is a no-op there and the tests still describe real behaviour on
    both backends.

    The context is cleared at the end. It is set at SESSION scope, so leaving
