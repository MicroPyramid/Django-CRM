"""
Row-Level Security (RLS) Configuration for PostgreSQL.

This module provides centralized configuration and SQL generators for
database-level multi-tenancy using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security.

RLS ensures that:
1. Queries automatically filter by current org
2. Even if application code misses a filter, data is protected
3. Direct SQL access respects org boundaries

Usage:
    from common.rls import RLS_CONFIG, get_enable_policy_sql

    # Enable RLS on a table
    cursor.execute(get_enable_policy_sql('lead'))

    # Check config
    tables = RLS_CONFIG['tables']

    # `security_audit_log` is deliberately NOT here. It is a platform-level
    # ledger, not tenant data: its `org` is `null=True` because the events it
    # exists to record happen outside any org (LOGIN_FAILURE, API_KEY_INVALID)
    # or deliberately straddle two (CROSS_ORG_ATTEMPT). The insert-check policy
    # compares `org_id::text` to `app.current_org`, and `NULL = anything` is not
    # true, so under the non-superuser role RLS_SETUP.md requires, every one of
    # those rows was refused. `AuditLogger._log` catches the failure and writes
    # a `logger.error`, so the audit trail was silently absent in exactly the
    # deployments configured correctly, for exactly the hostile events. It was
    # invisible because the dev database user is a superuser and CI ran SQLite.
    # `common/0036` drops the policies. Nothing outside a test reads the model,
    # and `common/tests/test_audit_log_not_exposed.py` keeps it that way: if an
    # endpoint ever needs to serve these rows, it must do the org filtering in
    # the ORM, because there is no policy underneath it.
