"""Scope vocabulary and request matcher for non-interactive credentials.

Two credentials reach this API without a human at the keyboard: a personal
access token (``bcrm_pat_…``, authenticates as its owning profile) and the
organization API key (``Token: <org.api_key>``, authenticates as an arbitrary
active ADMIN of that org). Both inherited the full permissions of the identity
they resolved to, which made a leaked one equivalent to a leaked session.

This module is the whole boundary. It is deliberately a pure function over
``(scopes, method, path)`` with no ORM and no request object, so it can be
tested exhaustively and reasoned about in one screen. Enforcement lives in
``common.middleware.get_company.GetProfileAndOrg``, the single choke point every
``/api/`` request already passes through, so a new view cannot forget to opt in.

THE GRAMMAR
    A scope is ``<resource>:<action>``.
    ``resource`` is an API root segment (the first path segment after ``/api/``)
    or ``*`` for all of them. ``action`` is ``read`` or ``write``.
    ``read`` covers GET/HEAD/OPTIONS; ``write`` covers POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.

``write`` does NOT imply ``read``. A token that may create leads but not list
them is a coherent thing to want, and a scope whose name understates what it
grants is how a boundary quietly stops being one.

AN EMPTY SCOPE LIST MEANS UNRESTRICTED
    Every token issued before this module existed carries ``scopes=[]``, and the
    documented behaviour has always been "inherits the owning profile's role".
    Treating ``[]`` as "nothing" would revoke every live token on deploy.
    Treating it as "everything" preserves exactly today's behaviour for them,
    and the credential deny-list below still applies.

THE DENY-LIST IS NOT A SCOPE
    ``CREDENTIAL_PATHS`` is checked first and cannot be satisfied by any scope,
    including ``[]``. A credential that can mint another credential cannot be
    revoked: revoke the token, and whatever it already created lives on. A
    credential that can read the org API key upgrades itself into a permanent
    org-admin key that outlives its own revocation. Both chains are closed here
    rather than in each view, because the view that forgets is the one that
    matters.

    ``/api/auth/`` is deliberately absent. Every view under it either pins
    ``authentication_classes = [JWTAuthentication]`` (MeView, OrgSwitchView,
    ProfileDetailView) or takes no authentication at all (the OAuth and
    magic-link entry points), so a bearer token never authenticates there. An
    entry that can never fire reads like a protection and is not one.
