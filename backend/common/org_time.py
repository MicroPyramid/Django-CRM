"""Resolving whose day it is.

Every "today", "overdue" and "this month" in this app goes through
``django.utils.timezone.localdate()``, which answers in whichever timezone is
currently active. This module is the one place that decides what that is.

Keeping it to one function is the point. The alternative, each view reaching for
``org.timezone`` itself, is how the codebase ended up with 132 sites computing
the day in UTC: a rule spread across 132 places cannot be changed, only
re-audited. Adding a per-user timezone later is a change to
``resolve_timezone_name`` and nothing else.

    Indian org to Africa/Abidjan the next time an admin saved the page.

    The offset travels with each name so a client can preselect a sensible
    default without shipping its own copy of the tz database. Mobile has no way
    to read the device's IANA name without a platform package, but every
    platform can report the device's current UTC offset, which narrows 490
    choices to a handful. It is the offset *now*, so it moves with daylight
