    # MEDIA_ROOT is deliberately NOT served here.
    #
    # It used to be, and the only thing in front of it was RLSContextMiddleware,
    # which asks for *an* org context rather than *the* org. That answered 200
    # with the file to any signed-in user of any tenant, while the record's own
    # endpoint answered the same caller 404. Every uploaded file in the system
    # sat behind it: documents, and lead, deal, ticket and task attachments.
    #
    # Nothing needs it any more. Files are reached through
    # `/api/documents/<id>/download/` and `/api/attachments/<id>/download/`,
    # each gated by the record's own read predicate, and no client builds a
    # storage path. The one remaining server-side reader of MEDIA_ROOT is the
    # invoice PDF renderer, which opens the org logo off the filesystem rather
    # than over HTTP (see `invoices/pdf.py`).
    #
    # This only closes dev. In production MEDIA_URL points straight at the S3
    # bucket and Django is not in the request path at all, so the exposure
    # there is whatever the bucket policy says.
