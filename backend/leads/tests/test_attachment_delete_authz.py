"""Authorization on `DELETE /api/leads/attachment/<pk>/`.

The lookup was `Attachments.objects.get(pk=pk)` with no org filter, so the only
thing standing between an admin of one tenant and another tenant's attachment
was Postgres RLS, and RLS is the safety net rather than the contract. It also
meant a missing or malformed id raised out of the view as a 500.

The uploader case is asserted for a `role="USER"` profile on purpose: it is the
direction the sibling opportunity view had dead through a `Profile` vs `User`
type mismatch, so an "it deletes fine" test written only as an admin would pass
against either implementation.
