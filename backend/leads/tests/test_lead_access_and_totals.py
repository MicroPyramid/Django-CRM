Both halves exist because the v2 leads pages are wired to this endpoint. The
list needed counts computed over the whole filtered set rather than the page,

`put` refuses anyone it should.

Every permission test asserts both directions. A check that can only return
False is indistinguishable from a check that is never reached.
